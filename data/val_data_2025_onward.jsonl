You lie awake at night, berating yourself: \u201cGo back to sleep, you idiot!\u201d Why not try what has worked flawlessly with other people for decades?\n\u201cDear body, dear brain, might the two of you work together in helping me go back to sleep? That\u2019d be awesome. Sleep is part of the solution , not the problem, you know? Worrying at night gets me nowhere, so if we could all pull together here, that would be amazing. Thank you so much!\u201d\nThere\u2019s no guarantee being kind to yourself will work, but it\u2019s almost certain yelling at the mirror will not. Ask yourself nicely, and you may discover your subconscious was your ally all along .<|end_of_text|>"}

But personally, I find it refreshing to receive them. It\u2019s nice to know there are no further words needed . Like a quiet nod among two people who aren\u2019t in the same room. \u201cGot it.\u201d Or, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this.\u201d Conversation settled. Both clear to move on.\nIf I\u2019m relieved to not get yet another message expecting a response, I\u2019m sure others must feel the same. So I emoji-react and watch what happens.

{"text":"### Title: The Backstory Is the Story\n\n### Content: \nTolkien\u2019s Silmarillion is a masterpiece. Not because of how well it is written, how coherent the story, or how illustrious its characters. It is a work of genius because Tolkien actually took the time, thought, and care to craft 5,000 years of backstory to his main works, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings .\n5,000 years! Can you even imagine? That\u2019s about as long as we\u2019ve been recording our actual history as humans. Tolkien drew maps, family trees, even invented his own languages to give everything an original name yet one with a meaning we can comprehend.\nOf course, like any human work, The Silmarillion is far from perfect. Compiled from endless of his father\u2019s notes by Tolkien\u2019s son Christopher, the book had to be whipped into shape. And of course, when you cover 5,000 years of history in 365 pages, not every character gets a full three-act treatment . Many have since been fleshed out in movies, TV shows, and fan fiction, starting from little more than the few sentences Tolkien originally dedicated to them.\nBut the fact that he devised not just a creation myth but an entire, five-millennia chronology for his work isn\u2019t a fun piece of trivia. It\u2019s a large part of the reason why what happens in the few years covered in his subsequent books resonates with millions of people around the world to this day.\nWhen someone in The Lord of the Rings talks about the island kingdom of N\u00famenor, the Balrogs of Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, or lembas, which is extra-nourishing Elven bread, all of those things mean something , and you can feel that meaning . You can look up each of those words and characters, and you\u2019ll find more lore behind them\u2014and regardless of whether you do so or not, the story itself hits different with all the weight of its backstory behind it.\nLife is not just what we see. It\u2019s also the invisible energy we put into what ultimately didn\u2019t remain for the senses to witness. The backstory is the story\u2014make sure you tend to it wherever you wish to tell a lasting tale .<|end_of_text|>"}

But when her only daughter Natalie, nicknamed \u201cSugar,\u201d is about to give birth, the soon-to-be grandmother becomes an unexpected pillar of support.\nWith everyone else having turned off their phone during the family restaurant\u2019s busy service hours, Donna and Nat end up at the hospital alone, and it makes for one heck of an episode of The Bear . Donna, brilliantly played by Jamie Lee Curtis, brings her daughter ice chips, shows her breathing exercises, and tells her stories to calm her down.\nWhen Nat wants to know about the day of her own birth, Donna launches into \u201cthe fish tank dream.\u201d She wasn\u2019t due for a few days, Donna explains. One night, home alone, she climbed into bed at 8 PM and fell into a deep sleep. \u201cAnd I had this\u2026this really vivid dream, but\u2014you know those kind of dreams where you\u2019re just doing normal stuff, but things are, like, super detailed?\u201d Sugar nods, and Donna continues.\nShe must have had the day off, Donna says, because in this \u201cnothing-dream,\u201d she was walking around the city. Not exactly her city\u2014the city of Chicago\u2014but some sort of hybrid between Chicago and New York. \u201cAnd\u2026and there was a fish tank.\u201d \u201cA fish tank?\u201d \u201cA big fish tank in the middle of the city. It was this giant fish tank, and I was the only one looking at it ,\u201d Donna says.\nSo there she was, standing in an all-grey city, all alone, looking at \u201ca mega, like a dentist office kind of fish tank.\u201d \u201cAnd I remember the colors were\u2026they were so sharp and vivid and neon, and I was the only one looking at it. It was beautiful.\u201d But then, after \u201cstaring at it for the longest time,\u201d something happened.\n\u201cAnd all of a sudden, I noticed that the glass started to come apart like it was gonna split,\u201d Donna continues. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t worried, you know?\u201d Somehow, even in her dream, she realized: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad, because I knew that more people were gonna get to see these beautiful fish.\u201d \u201cAnd then?\u201d \u201cThen I woke up, and I was sweating, and my water had broke.\u201d\nSometimes, we stare at a beautiful fish tank, and we don\u2019t want the dream to end . Our son is acing his tests. We have the perfect week at the office. A stock just keeps going up. But sooner or later, the glass always cracks. It doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing, you know?\nWhen you see the glass starting to come apart, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t think about the loss, or the shards, or the mess you\u2019ll have to clean up later. Some short-term pain might follow, but that\u2019s not the important part. Focus on what the break might set free for everyone, including you. Remember that more people will get to see these beautiful fish.\nIn order to discover the sea, we first must leave our aquarium. That\u2019s why it\u2019s okay if the glass breaks. As long as you keep swimming, it just might be good news .<|end_of_text|>"}

The company then applied \u201cthe Silicon Valley formula\u201d to its product, a juice dispenser. They made a sleek-looking machine that pressed juice made of fresh, local ingredients from specifically designed and verified packets. They charged $400 for that machine. They launched exclusively in California and only sold to customers via a subscription model. And a few months later, they shut down and failed.\nIt was a rare but gratifying example of Silicon Valley cutting its teeth on common sense\u2014because there were so many obvious flaws in the product, an eight-year-old could have told you it wouldn\u2019t work.\nThe dispenser couldn\u2019t actually make juice out of fruits or vegetables you bought at the store. It had to be the packets. Those packets were not just expensive, they also expired after only seven days. And once they did, the machine wouldn\u2019t press them. Oh, and to check that it shouldn\u2019t press the bag, the Juicero Press had to be hooked up to the internet, too. No wi-fi, no party . But what ultimately did them in was a one-minute video from Bloomberg : A reporter pressed the bags by hand, and voil\u00e0, the juice still came out just fine. In fact, it was probably faster than using the machine. Less than five months after that video, Juicero announced they were quitting .\nJust because something has millions, sometimes billions , of dollars behind it, that does not make it genius, useful, necessary, or even relevant. It can be billion-dollar bullshit . Don\u2019t be impressed too easily\u2014and whatever you buy into, make sure the juice is worth the squeeze .<|end_of_text|>"}

That\u2019s why \u201cthis might be the last time\u201d is a thought worth having on occasion.\nIt can, however, also be a useful tool. In Creative Doing , my friend Herbert Lui writes: \u201cLet go of your external expectations. Immerse yourself in the task at hand.\u201d One way to do so? Pretend it\u2019s the last time. Like Frank Sinatra did, at least according to his friend and fellow singer Bono : \u201cFully inhabiting the moment during that tiny dot of time after you\u2019ve pressed \u2018record\u2019 is what makes it eternal. If, like Frank, you sing it like you\u2019ll never sing it again. If, like Frank, you sing it like you never have before.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if this was the last time?\u201d The last time you\u2019ll write. The last video you\u2019ll shoot.

Talk about going in with intention! \u201cThis philosophy is applicable to your craft,\u201d Herbert writes. \u201cYou can pretend like it\u2019s the last time you\u2019re doing your work, the last chance you might be able to contribute to this piece of work. This immersion naturally lets expectations, hopes, and fears fade away; none of it matters.\u201d\nWhatever work you care about , the next time, pretend it\u2019s the last time.

In the world of Alita: Battle Angel , the opposite is true: With most people being at least partially cyborg, Dr. Dyson Ido, played by Christoph Waltz, repairs bodies all day long.\nWhen he finds a special soul, a mysterious teenage girl robot\u2014or what\u2019s left of her\u2014in the scrapyard, he restores her completely. Now in a cyborg body that was reserved for Ido\u2019s deceased daughter, Alita, the now-eponymous main character starts discovering who she is. Naturally, she completely wrecks her new frame in the process.\nThankfully, before returning to pieces, Alita found an old battle torso\u2014the very kind she used to operate in her past life. So for a second time, Dr. Ido mends Alita\u2019s body, and it is here that her journey comes to a crossroads. \u201cNow you know who you are,\u201d Ido tells her, pointing at the shiny nanotech covering Alita from head to toe. \u201cBut that\u2019s just a shell. It\u2019s not bad or good. That part\u2019s up to you.\u201d And sure enough, soon thereafter, Alita must choose how to use her newfound power \u2014and choose wisely and fast.\nMaybe one day, we, too, will be able to replace body parts as easily as we swap broken screens on our phones. Until then, however, our mortal forms will remain something even the most gifted engineer can\u2019t fix\u2014and yet, a body is just a shell. Why endlessly preserve a vessel with an expiry date if we don\u2019t intend to put it to good use? However capable or limited your physical frame, make sure you fill it with good while you can\u2014and don\u2019t worry about a little wear around the edges .<|end_of_text|>"}

They approach authors, and if they agree, their book will be discounted for a day or a month, and then Amazon will promote it.\nYears ago, I read on a blog that Daily Deals worked much better than Monthly Deals. The idea was that if a book is only discounted for 24 hours, Amazon will push it much harder, and thus you should sell more copies. The article even showed some statistics to back this up!\nMy books have been out for three and two years, respectively. So far, all I\u2019d ever gotten was the occasional Monthly Deal, and sure enough, they didn\u2019t really move the needle. Ergo, when I recently got an invite to do a Daily Deal for Indian readers, I was thrilled! Finally I might see Amazon\u2019s promotional powers on full display.\nBut the day came, and the day went, and I got zero sales. It\u2019s not like I had high expectations . How and when you get picked for these events is arbitrary to begin with.

You can write a poem with a rhyming scheme no one\u2019s ever used before.

For 2025, it\u2019s \u201cReset.\u201d\nWhen a ship traverses the sea for a long time, it\u2019ll accumulate barnacles on its hull. For the tiny crustaceans, it doesn\u2019t matter where they sit. They\u2019ll attach to any surface, as long as it supplies them with the water from which they get their nutrients. For the ship, however, in time, they become a heavy burden\u2014literally. And while the weight of the barnacles will rarely be enough to sink the vessel, it might slow it down or bring it out of balance.\n2024 was the year I realized: After ten years of writing and working for myself, I\u2019ve racked up too many barnacles. For the first half of those ten years, I was mostly learning, growing, finding myself as a writer, person, and entrepreneur. But from the pandemic onwards, everything was a blur. Financially, it was a rollercoaster, and the velocity of that ride kept me latching onto whatever next thing I could get a hold of. But in late 2023, there was nothing left to reach for, and my ship slowly started sinking.\nIt took me all year to process everything, to shed off my old identity , to rise from the ashes of a fire that had burned for a decade. And now that I\u2019ve finally accepted change is in order, well, it\u2019s time to scrape off some barnacles! Time to reset.\nThe word \u201creset\u201d means to start over, of course. To shut down, erase, reboot, and begin anew with a clean slate . But it also means to adjust. To fiddle with just slightly, so that an imbalanced, misaligned object may once again slot into its proper place. That, too, is \u201cre-setting.\u201d Moving a piece of the puzzle for the big picture to make sense. I\u2019ll need to do a lot of both, hence \u201cReset\u201d as my theme for 2025.\nMy work will be reset. I\u2019ve picked up a full-time job, and everything else will have to fit in around the edges . Four Minute Books will be reset. No more ads, affiliate revenue, or any form of monetization that is not me selling my own creations. Perhaps it\u2019ll have to be merged into this blog or disappear altogether. My writing will be re-set. I\u2019ll get a chance to realign on what I really want to write, but I\u2019ll also have to adjust to make time to then do that writing.\nIt\u2019s easy to reflect at the turn of the year, and I can only recommend picking an annual theme , but I also know this to be true: Reset buttons are everywhere . You can hit as many of them as you like at any time. Whether you need to re-set some planks or build a new ship altogether, don\u2019t wait. You deserve smooth sailing at all times\u2014and every removed barnacle counts .<|end_of_text|>"}

{"text":"### Title: Remembering This\n\n### Content: \nIn 2014, I was an intern at BMW M in Munich. I lived in a tiny apartment offered by the company that somehow still cost almost my entire below-minimum-wage salary. I was young, relatively broke, and single.\nFor the first three months, I had no internet. It was a deliberate choice so I\u2019d go out, get to know the city, and meet people. But that also meant I couldn\u2019t watch the very last episodes of How I Met Your Mother as they were released\u2014and my single-self really needed that inspiration. So every once in a while, I went to a coffee shop, bummed their wifi, and downloaded the latest episode. Then, the introvert and romantic in me could watch it in the quiet comforts of his home whenever all the intern buzz became too much.\nIn one of those episodes, Ted and the love of his life, Tracy, finally go on their first date. Naturally, it\u2019s awkward. The restaurant they\u2019re supposed to eat at is noisy and has terrible food choices. They bump into Tracy\u2019s ex and hide behind a car. By the time Ted is about to drop Tracy off at home, they both admit they\u2019re probably not ready for a new relationship. But then, right as the thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never see her again,\u201d forms in his head, for some reason, Tracy gives him a kiss. \u201cUnless\u2026do you want to walk around some more? It\u2019s still early.\u201d\nTed agrees and, as Tracy is standing three feet in front of him, holding out her hand, some cosmic intuition hits him. He doesn\u2019t really realize it, but deep down, it clicks: \u201cThis is it. So for a moment that feels like an eternity, he just stands there, staring. Until Tracy asks: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And to that, Ted can only offer the truth: \u201cRemembering this\u201d\u2014because in his soul, he knows this is a once-in-a-lifetime event he will carry with him forever. And just as quickly, Tracy says, \u201cCome on.\u201d They join hands, start walking, and the moment is passed\u2014 lost but not gone .\nI, too, will forever remember this scene. Not just the 10\/10 storytelling from a great TV show, but myself, sitting in that tiny room without internet, watching it play out on screen\u2014still single, still waiting for that special person , and, thanks to How I Met Your Mother , never losing faith that she is out there.\nLove is not all we want out of life, but it sure is an image, isn\u2019t it? Someone who holds out their hand to us and says, \u201cCome on! We\u2019ll walk together.\u201d Just so we can stand there and say, \u201cOkay. Yes. Thank you. I\u2019ve waited a long time for this.

Breathe deeply, listen to what your heart is telling you, and whenever the answer is, \u201cThis is it,\u201d ask for some extra time to process.

That\u2019s a recipe for disaster even on the best of days . But once people start dying under mysterious circumstances, all bets are off.\nLike Juliet\u2019s boyfriend, George, who \u201cfell down the stairs.\u201d So when she miraculously gets the opportunity to become the new sheriff in town, of course Juliet agrees. Who wouldn\u2019t want to investigate the murder of a loved one with appropriate resources? But naturally, Juliet soon has more enemies than she\u2019s ever had friends. It\u2019s hard, and for every question she answers, two new ones land on her desk.\nOne night, she discovers that even George wasn\u2019t 100% straight with her. Talking to one of the few people in her corner, Juliet admits she is ready to call it quits : \u201cI\u2019m gonna turn in the badge and resign.\u201d Her friend being a real one, she asks her if she took the job only for George or \u201cbecause it was the right thing to do.\u201d\nAnd then, after a short lecture, the kind we all need at times, she leaves Juliet with a truly great piece of advice: \u201cSee, I don\u2019t know what happened, but when you left here, love had you trying to do the right thing. And now anger is making you give up? That is a waste of time.\u201d\nWhen the next step feels like your shoes are, like the Silo, made of concrete, think back: Why did you pick this trail? Revenge, grief, anger\u2014there are plenty of bad reasons to begin. But if you ventured out from a place filled with kindness and good intentions, why quit in frustration? Clearly, that\u2019s not the same spirit, and though your mind might be the same, it likely isn\u2019t as clear.\nDon\u2019t give up in anger what you started in love. The road only ends where your emotions run out, and most of the time, your last stop should mirror the one where your journey began.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Driving a T-Rex\n\n### Content: \nI used to visit a friend\u2019s house after school in the 90s. We played Need for Speed 2 on his computer. Thanks to a bunch of cheat codes , you could turn the game from a challenging car race into a completely ridiculous experience. I distinctly remember driving a T-rex around a Hollywood studios\u2013inspired track at 200+ kilometers per hour. It was insane\u2014but also insanely fun.\nAfter finding the level and car on Youtube , one of the comments on the video stood out to me: \u201cI miss the times when cheats made no sense and actually added a lot of fun to games.\u201d My memory is a good example: I can barely recall any of the cars in the game, let alone the different tracks \u2014but I can remember that T-rex-in-Hollywood experience any day of the week.\nSometimes, the things that make no sense are actually the few things that do. Don\u2019t dismiss the quirky, fun, or seemingly irrelevant. One day, either of those qualities might be the only one that remains .<|end_of_text|>"}

As you look back on a decade of work, you realize what felt like a trip through the jungle was actually baking a layer cake, with many artifacts now remaining. But what will you do with them? All those websites and email signup forms and social profiles.\nYou could just leave them behind and allow them to catch dust. You could try maintaining it all, but that\u2019s unrealistic. Chances are, you\u2019ll want to curate some for future use, prep others for maintenance mode, and others still you may just delete altogether . But which shall be which, and when will you do all that work now that you\u2019ve got a job?\nA change in life seasons can feel like a massive wave coming at you. Before you\u2019re done saying goodbye , you\u2019re already knee-deep in new waters. That\u2019s okay! Life is not a relay race, and even in those the handover can be messy. Switching waves rarely works as neatly as closing one book and opening another.\nWhether it\u2019s the old tide going out or the new one coming in, big waves take time. In fact, isn\u2019t the opportunity to surf on them for longer the very best thing about them? But to do so, you must allow them to break slowly. Don\u2019t rush transitions. There\u2019ll be a time and a place for everything, and as long as you\u2019re on the beach, you\u2019re in the right place .<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Flick It Again\n\n### Content: \nWe have a big cuddle blanket on our couch. It\u2019s massive. Two by two meters or so. In the winter, we use it every night, and every morning, I fold it back into shape .\nTo wrestle this unwieldy piece of cloth into a square, I take two of the corners, overlay them, and fold it in half. But then I\u2019ve still got a long, if slightly narrower, sheet in front of me. So, to get the corners at the other end to overlay as well, I flick the blanket, and a big wave travels through the comforter. Hopefully, by the time it reaches the end, the two halves of the sheet will line up more closely. Often, they don\u2019t\u2014so I just flick it again.\nSometimes, it takes me three, four tries to get the edges to align, but sooner or later, I always get a layout I can work with. Then, it\u2019s only a matter of lining up the side I\u2019m holding with the other one, folding it over two more times, and voil\u00e0! A neatly folded, square cuddle blanket sits on the sofa, ready to open up again at night.\nLife forces us through many a coin toss , but most of the time, there\u2019s zero cost to giving the slot machine another spin. Randomness is everywhere, and while it\u2019ll often obstruct your way forward, as soon as you give it another go, it might just as well clear a smooth path for you.\nIf anything could happen, there\u2019s always reason to expect something good the next time. The only difference between a stony journey and a red carpet might be another coin toss\u2014so whenever your blanket won\u2019t fall into place, make sure you flick it again.<|end_of_text|>"}

Sometimes, you\u2019ll only peck once for the day.\nRegardless of your pace, just keep pecking\u2014and whether it\u2019s the weather, a difficult project, or your body, sooner or later, life will set itself right yet again.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: An Eternity for a Steppenwolf\n\n### Content: \nA \u201cSteppenwolf\u201d is a kind of wolfhound, half wild animal, half domesticated pet. In Hermann Hesse\u2019s novel of the same name , protagonist Harry claims to be a specimen of this very variety, forever torn between a life outside society\u2019s expectations and the comfort of hiding his lofty ideals in plain sight: among pubs, discussions about politics, and everything else mundane .\nDuring a visit to an old friend\u2019s house, Harry notices an embellished painting of Goethe, whom he adores,  but whose stylized icon he despises. Later, Goethe visits him in a dream only to tease him about his snobby attitude, eventually fading into darkness with \u201ca still and soundless laughter that shook him to the depths with abysmal old-man\u2019s humor.\u201d\nMuch later in the book, Harry realizes what his dream was really about. It wasn\u2019t an old man laughing at a deeply broken and depressed individual. It was an immortal being pointing the way to inner peace . Here\u2019s my translation attempt from the original German:\n\u201cIt was without object, this laughter. It was only light, only brightness, was that which remains when a real human has passed through the suffering, the vices, the errors, desires, and misunderstandings of humans and made it to eternity, to space. And eternity was nothing more than the salvation of time, was in a way its return to innocence, its reconversion into space.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t really understand Hesse\u2019s words. I don\u2019t think Harry did either. Or that, really, anyone ever will. But I also kind of did, because after witnessing Harry\u2019s story for 200 pages, as for him, Hesse\u2019s imagery gave me a deep sense of peace. \u201cAhhh, eternity. What a great comfort to know we are but a speck of time in an infinite space. Why get worked up about the petty issues of existence? Why not just laugh about them?\u201d That\u2019s what the passage seems to say.\nIf you\u2019re reading this blog, chances are, you, too, are a Steppenwolf. There\u2019s the you that goes to work and cleans the sink and pays the bills and does all the things. But there\u2019s also something deep inside, and it keeps scratching, scratching at all the surface-level stuff we call \u201cliving,\u201d desperate, hoping, yearning for something more.\nI don\u2019t know where that \u201cmore\u201d is for you. I don\u2019t know if any of us will ever find it. But I know people like Hermann Hesse, the kind of people who write the kind of books like Der Steppenwolf , they all felt it too, and so when I read those books , I don\u2019t feel alone. I feel connected. Quiet. Seeking yet satisfied. My inner wolf isn\u2019t howling\u2014and perhaps that\u2019s all the eternity a Steppenwolf will ever need.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Helping Is a Decision\n\n### Content: \nThis morning, my girlfriend and I needed a quick snack before a big event. There were no bakeries near our hotel, and we didn\u2019t have time for a full breakfast. When she went down and asked if we could purchase two croissants or so, the lady said: \u201cOh, just grab a plate and take whatever! No charge.\u201d\nIt was the right bit of luck at the right time\u2014but it was also a decision. In the end, helping others always is, and even when it seems like no big deal to you, for them, it might go a long way. The situation reminded me of a Bruce Lee quote : \u201cI\u2019m not one of those guys that can brush people off. Besides, I feel that if I can just take a second to make someone happy, why not do it?\u201d\nUltimately, when you help someone, you help everyone \u2014but even if it\u2019s just karma points you\u2019re after, why not collect them every time you get a chance?<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Life Is Not a Simulation\n\n### Content: \nThe movie Sully deals with the complications of becoming a hero . To the public, the situation was obvious: Chesley Sullenberger landed a jet plane with no functioning engines on the Hudson river and saved 155 people\u2019s lives\u2014give the man a medal, and let\u2019s be grateful for some good news.\nAccording to the movie, however, it wasn\u2019t all sunshine and roses. As is customary in plane incidents, the National Transportation Safety Board conducted an investigation. What were the actual facts of the situation? Why were the choices made that were made? And how could the outcome have been improved?\nDuring the climax of the movie, the NTSB investigators show simulations of real pilots navigating the same conditions. The birds strike, the engines fail, they turn back to the nearest airport, and voil\u00e0, perfect landing! Why didn\u2019t Sully just do that instead of risking crashing his plane into ice-cold water?\nThe answer is that life\u2014 real life \u2014is not a simulation. \u201cYou have allowed no time for analysis and decision-making,\u201d Sully tells the board. \u201cWith these sims, you have taken all the humanity out of the cockpit.\u201d How many practice runs have those pilots gone through before recording these simulations, Sully wants to know. The number almost gets stuck in the investigator\u2019s throat: \u201c17.\u201d They agree to another live run, and with as little as 35 seconds of delay, all simulation pilots crash their planes despite having the perfect plan in their pocket .\nNo matter how authentic it feels, in the end, no video game will be the same as life itself. Reality needs evidence , and real effort with real sacrifice is a kind of proof you just can\u2019t fake.\nThat\u2019s a point made not only in the movie but also by the movie itself: After its release, the NTSB criticized the depiction of its investigators. No one was \u201cout to embarrass anybody at all,\u201d they said. And in the actual hearing featuring Sully and his copilot, all simulations pointed to the same truth to begin with: \u201cA successful return to LaGuardia or a diversion to Teterboro Airport was not assured\u201d\u2014and therefore, Sully was exactly the hero everyone saw in the news all along.\nDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t stack up in imaginary competitions. Live, and play, and do your best right here in the realm of physics, and you\u2019ll always score your points in the only game that really counts.<|end_of_text|>"}

But there\u2019s a difference between water coming out of the sky or the ground and fresh H2O pouring out of your tap, and you only realize how big of a difference it is when you\u2019re left without your usual conveniences .\nCould I catch some of the rainwater? Sure. But then I\u2019d have to filter it to drink it, heat it up in the boiler or the microwave if I want it warm, and pour some into a bowl whenever I want to wash my hands . Could I even collect enough for a bath? Who knows. But on days like today, you realize how un-basic the basics actually are. Pipes, heating, filtering, countless mechanisms work invisibly day and night so we can wash hands whenever, make coffee whenever, shower hot or cold whenever.\nIt\u2019s a good tradition, this reset. I hope they\u2019ll repair or maintain the water system at least once a year. That way, every time I scoop another cup from my prefilled bathtub, then filter it for next steps, I\u2019ll remember: Appreciate the basics\u2014because without them, whatever we hope to build on top of their foundation would collapse like a house of cards.<|end_of_text|>"}

How did they do it? All the barista could do was shrug: \u201cBeats me. It\u2019s such a saturated market. But the demand was just too big.\u201d\nUsually, caf\u00e9s in Munich don\u2019t expand. If anything, they shut down. But this one, whether for its vibe, great cinnamon rolls, arguably excellent coffee, or all of those factors combined, is thriving. They didn\u2019t have a master plan when they opened\u2014clearly: It was in the middle of the pandemic. They just showed up, made the best coffee they could, and four years later, here we are.\nWriting a bestseller, landing your dream job, raising a fully self-sufficient human\u2014all of these are impractical, yet none impossible . In fact, we\u2019re doing the impossible every day , so why not work our magic on the dreams we truly care about?

{"text":"### Title: Don\u2019t Check Your Analytics\n\n### Content: \nYesterday, I checked my blog analytics so I could share last year\u2019s 10 most popular posts based on views. I learned some lessons, but first, here they are:\n- \u200b The Teacher Who Made Mistakes on Purpose \u200b\u200b\n- \u200b The Lord Who Never Lost a Battle \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b Are You Taking the Bait? \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b It Is Not Strength That Overcomes Darkness \u200b\u200b\n- \u200b \u201cI Think\u201d \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b An Invitation to Dance \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b Tomorrow Is Tomorrow \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b 2 Kinds of Fate \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b To Solve Your Problems, Start \u200b \u200b\n- \u200b Against the Odds\nAs I was going through the data, I noticed some patterns. Five observations stood out:\n- Don\u2019t check your analytics unless you have to. It\u2019s a much better way to write and, quite frankly, live. I\u2019m not exactly checking it only once a year, but I do it a lot less than I used to. I\u2019m happier for it.\n- The only true growth is the growth you didn\u2019t manufacture . Before Google drastically changed its algorithm and everything fell off a cliff, my peak traffic for the blog was 65,000 views in one month. It dropped to 20,000 and stayed there for a good while. Once I started my daily blog , however, I stopped trying to optimize posts for anything, let alone search engines. This is my hill , and here I just write what I want. It was nice to see the blog growing again despite my disregard for results. This month, I\u2019m up to 45,000 views or so.\n- Five of the top 10 posts featured scenes from TV shows . Turning moments from film and television into little stories has always been a favorite of mine . I\u2019m having so much fun with it. Granted, those also end up featured on Google or quoted elsewhere more frequently, so there might be a bit of bias in them getting more views. Also: Three of them referenced the same show, Shogun . Apparently everyone else loved it as much as I did.\n- Enjoy when your work goes viral, but don\u2019t count on it . The #1 post was the one my friend Herbert shared on Hacker News. I\u2019m grateful for it, but I\u2019m not gonna start trying to hack Hacker News.\n- Popular is relative . Views are merely the best proxy I have. Most of the above posts still only got a few hundred views. It\u2019s not like each one was ten times more popular than the next. If I had picked posts based on which ones got the most email responses, the list would have looked very different. It\u2019s just harder to assemble that data.\nIt is turning out to be a multi-year process for me to unhook my art from ulterior motives and external results. I hope I can get there. Hence, 2025: the year of the re-set . Let\u2019s see where I\u2019m at in December\u2014and, hopefully, that\u2019ll be the first time I check my analytics.<|end_of_text|>"}

Of course, Google would prefer I throw some money at the problem. \u201cJust pay us $30\/year, and we\u2019ll give you more digital space!\u201d I usually react by relentlessly deleting old files , but here, I\u2019m tempted\u2014because email is different.\nMy emails go back all the way to 2008. I just found the first digital product I ever bought. A typical get-rich-quick scheme for a few bucks, back in 2010. Now, I can write about the experience. If I delete the confirmation email, I can\u2019t do that anymore, can I? I\u2019ll never stumble into it again, let alone find it on purpose.\nSure, my inbox has lots and lots of irrelevant emails. Notifications. Updates from groups I\u2019m no longer a part of. One-liners, saying, \u201cOkay,\u201d \u201cConfirmed,\u201d or \u201cFYI.\u201d But it also contains precious memories, personal conversations with friends, travel plans, and more. I find my inbox hosts a special kind of memorabilia: Stuff that\u2019s personal but usually not too intimate, interesting but not critical. Take it all together, however, and you\u2019d be throwing away a big chunk of your life.\nWhat about my first business records as a self-employed person? What if I need to prove in court at some point that I sent this email or that one, that I had certain documents, or that I bought a product when I say I bought it? Maybe one day, my emails can offer me legal protection.\nYour inbox sure is a mess. It\u2019s full of irrelevant data. Sometimes, it\u2019s even a crowdsourced to-do list made for you by other people, a to-do list you\u2019ll still have to get through . But in a way, your inbox is also the ultimate insurance policy: It\u2019s filled with creativity, memories, and proof.\nWill I cough up the money to keep my emails around? I don\u2019t know.

{"text":"### Title: Be Early, or Don\u2019t Be at All\n\n### Content: \nIn 2019, I posted every day on Substack for four months straight. My newsletter went from 0 to 4,000 subscribers. It was 100% organic growth with almost zero promotion.\nFive years later, in 2024, I started a new, different newsletter on the platform. I again posted every day for four months straight. And again, I did almost no external promotion. This time, I went from 0 to 500 subscribers.\nThere are various factors at play here. Maybe my 2019 publication was more appealing. Maybe the barrage of new features on the platform, from chat to video to tweet-style notes, has diluted how many people subscribe to a newsletter.\nBut there is one element I\u2019ve observed repeatedly on several platforms, and it\u2019s undeniable: timing . If you can\u2019t be early and catch a platform\u2019s biggest growth spurt, often, it\u2019s not worth being there at all\u2014especially if engaging on a variety of platforms is only part of a larger, long-term game you\u2019re playing.\nI once did the math for this on Medium . As it turned out, a writer who had started in 2018 and posted ten times as many successful articles as a comparable writer in 2016 only grew to about two thirds of his followers. The verdict was clear:\nA great writer starting in 2020 will take longer to reach 10,000 followers than a mediocre one did in 2016. This isn\u2019t fair, but it\u2019s still true. On top of hard work, perseverance, and continued adaptation, maybe more so than all of the former combined, you need impeccable timing to grow in a maturing market.\nThe problem with timing is not just predicting it, which is impossible, but also to execute on it even if you could. Attention has become an ever-shapeshifting beast attracted to new places every month. Feeding those places with your ideas and generosity isn\u2019t a job you can do in a weekend. It\u2019s a massive, often multi-year detour, and even in a best-case scenario, who can afford such detours from the work they actually mean to do?\nCall me old-school, but given how hard it is to be early and how fragile its payoff even if you are, perhaps the best way to play social media is to not play at all . Pick your own hill on the internet, and defend it \u2014because that\u2019s something you can be as late to as you want, yet once you arrive there, it\u2019ll pay its own kind of dividends every day.<|end_of_text|>"}

You won\u2019t get the same result as if you\u2019d kept pulling on those threads way back when, but you\u2019ll still get some continuation of a phase of life you\u2019ve enjoyed\u2014and, made with the right timing , that can be worth just as much, if not more, as a new experience altogether.<|end_of_text|>"}

Just days tipping, one into the next, into the next, in a long line between the beginning\u2026and the end. But I was wrong. It\u2019s not like that at all. Our moments fall around us like rain. Or\u2026 snow. Or confetti.\u201d\nEven without cursed houses pulling a multiverse on us, we, too, can see time rain into our lives like confetti. A memory from the distant past throws us for a loop. A vision of the future distracts us or scares us. We can only live in the present , but we\u2019re not always here, are we? According to Nell, that needn\u2019t be a bad thing. Though she won\u2019t be able to leave the house, her siblings just might.\n\u201cI am not gone. I\u2019m scattered into so many pieces, sprinkled on your life like new snow. Think of me when you stand in the rain. I loved you completely. And you loved me the same. That\u2019s all. The rest is confetti.\u201d\nEvery morning, we wake up , and we try our best with what we have for the people we love. It won\u2019t make us perfect. Sometimes, we\u2019ll get lost in a storm of confetti. But, at the end of the day, it is just shreds of colored paper\u2014we can watch out for it, marvel at it, get distracted by it\u2026but when we decide to put our heads down and focus on what matters most, it can never throw us off course for too long.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Anxiety Blankets\n\n### Content: \nAsked why he went back to drinking coffee after living without it for 30 days and seeing many benefits, Tim Ferriss said : \u201cI use coffee as a security blanket when my life gets hit with something unpredictable or things seem a little out of control. So even though I realize, intellectually, that it\u2019s counterproductive [\u2026], my response to feeling a little anxious is to want coffee\u2014even though it increases anxiety physiologically.\u201d\nI, too, use coffee in much the same way. I don\u2019t need the caffeine kick by any means. My mind is too active as it is. But I love the taste and the feeling of holding a warm cup in my hand. It makes me feel that I can deal with whatever daggers might be flying my way . The irony, of course, is that coffee in almost any quantity also makes me jittery and less focused. It seldom enhances my productivity. Between fidgeting and now worrying about fidgeting so much, I basically stay nervous\u2014the source of my shakiness has changed but not its presence.\nI wonder how many people drink coffee mainly for the same reason. For how many it\u2019s \u201ca life raft of consistency,\u201d as Tim calls it. I can imagine the number being in the billions. That\u2019s what we do, isn\u2019t it? We make blankets to cover our anxiety only to realize we\u2019ve knitted a comforter made of anxiety of a slightly different color. No wonder it rarely works.\nI don\u2019t know if and when I\u2019ll quit coffee for the last time. I\u2019ve done it for seven days, 40 days, even 100 days. But always, for some emotional reason, I return. The lesson is a hard one to act on but still one that rings true: If your anxiety blanket is made out of anxiety, it\u2019s only a matter of time before you\u2019re cold again\u2014so maybe what you need isn\u2019t a cover but a new outfit altogether .<|end_of_text|>"}

{"text":"### Title: Early Following Is Leading\n\n### Content: \nIn 2010, Derek Sivers gave a short-and-sweet TED talk that changed my understanding of leadership forever. Showing a short clip of a shirtless guy dancing by himself at a music festival, Derek explains: \u201cFirst, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.\u201d Well, that part I knew. It\u2019s the part every movie, book, interview, and case study explains over and over again.\nIn this particular case, however, the leader\u2019s 100% improvised dance moves are easy to follow. Therefore, soon, his first follower joins him, taking on a role that, as it turns out, is just as crucial as the leader\u2019s: \u201cThe first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader,\u201d Sivers says. This is \u201can underestimated form of leadership in itself.\u201d After all, the first follower will stand out almost as much as the leader.\nAs soon as the third person joins, however, we\u2019re no longer talking about one or two lone nuts. \u201cThree is a crowd, and a crowd is news,\u201d Sivers continues. Shortly thereafter, two more people join, then three more, then people already start running so they can \u201cbe part of the in-crowd.\u201d Before long, not dancing would put you in the minority, and so within minutes, everyone is on their feet\u2014\u201dand that\u2019s how you make a movement,\u201d Sivers concludes.\nWhether it\u2019s an employee pitching a new initiative, a mom setting up a baking meetup, or a lonely dancer following the beat: An original leader\u2019s courage sure is unparalleled . But if their vision is to become more visceral, a real community people want to be a part of and help push forward, they need a first follower to bridge the gap between them and the rest of the world.\nThat follower might not carry quite the same desire or creative spark that the leader does, but they\u2019ll risk almost as much ridicule, all while comforting the lone nut as they keep dancing, normalizing their behavior for others to see and consider joining the cause. They rarely get it, but a first follower deserves just as much recognition as the visionary leading the charge.\nAre you the former or the latter? It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014because early following, too, is leading, and we need all the lights in the sky that we can get.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Connecting Is Leading\n\n### Content: \nMy friend Mike hates giving presentations. He doesn\u2019t enjoy being the center of attention in a group of people. He\u2019d also be the last to volunteer to do role plays at work. Despite this, nobody I know would hesitate to call Mike a leader. In his own words, he just \u201c leads from behind .\u201d\nMike has worked as a freelancer for many years. I\u2019ve never seen him pitch to get clients. People just \u201cfind him.\u201d I\u2019m always amazed at how many people he knows, who he knows, and how he bumps into the right person at the right time. Needless to say, if I\u2019m trying to connect with some person or company, Mike is the first person I ask.\n\u201cConnect\u201d is the right keyword. Malcolm Gladwell would call Mike \u201ca Connector.\u201d In The Tipping Point , Gladwell describes them as \u201cpeople with a special gift for bringing the world together.\u201d They are \u201cthe kinds of people who know everyone,\u201d and \u201call of us know someone like this.\u201d My friend Ted from third grade is a Connector. At our annual city festival reunion , you can\u2019t walk ten meters without him shaking hands with someone. My friend Marc from my Master\u2019s is another Connector. He\u2019s had dinner or worked with seemingly every other person in Munich.\nConnectors aren\u2019t leaders in a typical sense. They don\u2019t sketch out some socially or technologically utopian vision and then rally everyone around them to make it come true. They don\u2019t necessarily love the limelight. But lead they do nonetheless\u2014lead you to people, places, and new possibilities.\nWhen I met Mike, I introduced him to other people I knew. Most of them were writers. Mike, on the other hand, connected me both to new people inside my bubble as well as folks completely outside of it. As Gladwell said, we all know Connectors\u2014but we rarely consider how priceless of a friend these people actually are. That was one of the key findings of his book: Yes, the entire world is connected in a surprisingly tight network, but that network runs through just a handful of people. Remove the Connectors, and the entire network collapses.\nIf you\u2019re neither a leader in the most traditional sense of the word nor a first follower , you might be a Connector. Connecting, too, is leading. And if you\u2019re not? Then that just means you\u2019re a leader of another kind\u2014and that you have all the more reason to be grateful for the Connectors in your life.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: The 3 Kinds of Eternity\n\n### Content: \nHarry, the antihero of Hermann Hesse\u2019s Steppenwolf , suffers a prolonged, fundamental identity crisis. One idea that gives him comfort is the concept of eternity , which various supporting characters define anew for him in illustrious ways.\nThere is Goethe, for example, who appears to Harry on several occasions, claiming that \u201ceternity is but a moment, just long enough for a joke.\u201d Harry\u2019s friend Hermine, on the other hand, claims that eternity is \u201cthe realm of the real,\u201d including such great human feats as the music of Mozart, epic poems, and the saints who provided a great example for their fellow men. \u201cBut eternity also includes the image of every real deed, the strength of every real emotion, even if no one knows about it and sees it and writes it down for posterity. In eternity, there is no posterity, only the contemporary.\u201d\nIt all sounds mysterious and vague at first, but if you sit with it, you\u2019ll see that, in essence, Harry\u2019s friends are drawing a map for him, and that map breaks down into three particular kinds of eternity:\n- Liberating insignificance : Compared to the age of history, the age of Earth, the age of the universe, you are but a grain of dust in the desert. Most likely, nothing you do will ever matter, and even if it does\u2014what are 500 years of remembering Shakespeare against millions of years of his nonexistence? Nothing has meaning, so don\u2019t take your life and yourself so seriously.\n- Empowering significance : Paradoxically, at the same time that nothing matters, everything is indelible. When you stroke your partner\u2019s cheek, that\u2019s real. When you eat a piece of fish, that\u2019s real. And when you feel a strong emotion while looking at a painting , that, too, is real. Everything you do, feel, and experience is definitive, and it will all become an infinitesimally small part of that gargantuan, overwhelming tapestry that is eternity. So in a way, everything has meaning, and perhaps you should act accordingly .\n- Transcending presence : If both everything and nothing we do becomes part of eternity, how are we to live? As Harry\u2019s friends hint at and he eventually realizes, \u201ceternity was nothing more than the salvation of time, was in a way its return to innocence, its reconversion into space.\u201d In other words: Live in the present. Give yourself fully to every moment, because in an existence where time squeezes us from both sides, with both crushing pressure and debilitating meaninglessness, the only path forward is to transcend time by surrendering to it. Once we relinquish control, we are free.\nIn the novel, Harry recognizes this last kind of eternity, the final stage of enlightenment, by a particular type of laughter he hears throughout the book. \u201cThe laughter of the immortals,\u201d he calls it. It\u2019s not laughing at someone. It\u2019s \u201conly light, only brightness.\u201d An innocent, childlike, wholehearted laughter from deep within. Whenever he hears this laughter, be it from Goethe in a dream or from himself in a strange situation he takes with surprising ease, Harry knows: Eternity is but a moment, just long enough for a joke\u2014and that\u2019s all we need for a lifetime of happiness.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: One Does Not Love Breathing\n\n### Content: \nScout is smart for her age. By the time she goes to school, she can already read. Her teacher, instead of being amazed, sees her as a threat\u2014to the other children but also to herself. When she is told to \u201ctell her father to stop teaching her at home,\u201d which he never has, she realizes for the first time: \u201cWhat I have is precious, and there are people out there who\u2019d take it away from me.\u201d\nIt is at this point in To Kill a Mockingbird that Harper Lee issues a profound observation through her six-year-old protagonist: \u201cUntil I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.\u201d\nThis idea has two implications: For one, love and worry go hand in hand . If you\u2019re not at least a little concerned about losing what you have, chances are you don\u2019t love it\u2014or, more importantly, them \u2014all that much.\nFor another, a small-minded teacher attacking a child might make us realize that we needn\u2019t justify what comes naturally. Scout happened to sit on her father\u2019s lap when he was reading the newspaper for so many hours, eventually, she picked up the words. Why would she have to defend herself for continuing to collect more of them as she went along? In a way, when we justify what we do for its own sake, we\u2019ve already lost. It\u2019s not our job to comply with the world\u2019s expectations .\nWhen it comes to the people, activities, and experiences pulling at your heartstrings, don\u2019t worry about being worried\u2014and remember there\u2019s no need to justify what comes as naturally as moving new air into your lungs.<|end_of_text|>"}

Whereas the Templars would rather do away with free will and keep the world at peace by putting it to sleep, the Assassins insist on their right to make mistakes and live with the consequences\u2014for better or for worse.\nIn the movie and video game series, both sides take drastic measures to serve their aims. In the real world, most of us live much closer to Templar rule than Assassin chaos. It is usually convention that traps us, not bucking the trend once too often. And while the answer lies not in a cape and a hidden blade, it may hide in a gray, foggy area we commonly dare not enter.\nNothing is true. Everything is permitted. Truth is subjective . Identity is optional . That\u2019s what the creed reminds us of when we need to break the mold. It\u2019s okay to say no . It\u2019s okay to have a quirky hobby .

{"text":"### Title: Wooden Boxes\n\n### Content: \nLast summer, I went for a hike . At the top of the mountain, there was the obligatory hut for rest and nourishment, but also a tiny chapel. I went inside and, on the left-hand wall, there was a wooden box. Kind of like a picture frame, but deeper, and with a simple pane of glass to protect its contents.\nInside the box, several small, two-page flyers adorned the backside of this construction. 19, in fact. Each of them was held up by a pin, clearly visible to any chapel visitor, and each flyer came with the same elements: a name, a photograph, a line of poetry or a Bible verse, and two dates. Born. Died. 19 times. 19 people. 19 destinies in one wooden box.\nSometimes the picture was in color; sometimes it was black-and-white. Sometimes the gap between the two dates was large; at other times it was rather small. 84 years. 63 years. 41 years. 34 years. 17 years. Some of the flyers had a mountain on them, signifying the person had died during a climb . Others showed a firefighter in gear, a man in his garden, a young girl taking a selfie.\nIt was a somber moment. One minute you\u2019re enjoying the sun on a hike, the next you stumble into death. But it was also beautiful. A miniature shrine which made it easy to linger. To pause for a few minutes and pay respects\u2014to people I never knew, but all of whom were loved by someone . Someone who made that flyer, ventured up the mountain, and pinned it to this wooden box.\nIt seems we all end up in one of those one way or another. It could be a large one, a small one, or one framed with glass in a small chapel in the middle of nowhere. But a wooden box it shall be regardless. Taking a beat in front of the ones we\u2019re not in isn\u2019t the only way to celebrate life while we have it, yet there are worse places to start.\nInhale esprit, exhale mountain air and memories. Do it every day. Collect moments, and respect those before and around you. That way, whichever wooden box you\u2019ll land in, you won\u2019t be alone\u2014and whoever comes to say hello will feel your energy long after you can no longer shake their hand.<|end_of_text|>"}

Thanks to the developers\u2019 creative efforts, the five-act ballad is a full-fledged piece of art, both in English and Japanese, and it has been featured in Final Fantasy game releases spanning almost 30 years .\nWhereas most of those games turn Loveless into a small easter egg , however, in Crisis Core , Genesis insists on bending the entire storyline to fit his favorite poem\u2019s narrative. Three friends, a goddess bearing a mysterious gift, estrangement, strife, and sacrifice: Loveless has it all. So when Genesis\u2019 original plan to cure his genetic disease fails, he figures why not turn himself into a tragic hero?\nAs he recites line after line from Loveless every time you encounter him, Genesis sure has an idea of how he\u2019d like things to go . For him. For you. For both of your childhood friends. But even in his determination, he admits he doesn\u2019t truly know which role he will play. Will it be the hero? The prisoner? The lost friend to make a last-minute return? It seems Genesis almost doesn\u2019t mind.\nIn the end, Genesis won\u2019t become the hero he wishes to be. Yet, somehow, he\u2019ll still see most of Loveless enacted in a way that makes him proud to have been part of \u201cthe production.\u201d And as fans and players try to decipher the poem\u2019s real meaning, perhaps it issues one reminder to us above all: It\u2019s okay to write a script for your life \u2014and even if you don\u2019t get to be the protagonist, it can still be worth the while. After all, if the play is great, what does it matter which role you\u2019ll portray?\n\u201cEven if the morrow is barren of promises, nothing shall forestall my return,\u201d some of Loveless \u2018 final lines read.

By the time Jem hits sixth grade, he actually gets interested in what school has to offer . Unfortunately for Scout, whatever he learns he blows out of proportion when relaying it to her.\nDid she know the Egyptians walked with one arm to the front, the other to the back? Or that they invented toilet paper? That they were smarter than Americans in South Alabama ever could be? But whenever Jem\u2019s phantasms spin around Scout\u2019s head a little too fast, she can recall a piece of advice from her father Atticus, a line that deserves recognition well beyond the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird : \u201cDelete the adjectives, and you\u2019ll have the facts.\u201d\nAs imaginative as Jem\u2014and most other people, for that matter\u2013might be, he is also lazy . It\u2019s much easier to make a real history lesson seem larger than it was than to invent one from scratch. Therefore, though it might not get Scout the whole truth, removing all judgments is a good start. And guess what? The approach to discernment that worked well for rural Alabamians 90 years ago has lost none of its shine today. If anything, clickbait headlines, impulsive tweets, and unchecked modern-day gossip have probably made it all the more warranted.\nWhether it\u2019s your older brother, a news outlet, or a not-so-rigorous friend: Delete the adjectives, get the facts\u2014and then slowly accumulate the truth from there.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Writing on Graph Paper\n\n### Content: \nOn yesterday\u2019s train, a teacher sat across my table. He was grading a history exam. The students\u2019 longhand writing and little notes he left reminded me of my time in school.\nAt one point, he moved from one exam to the next, and the style of paper changed. So far, all of the students\u2019 answers had been written on lined paper, but this one had used graph paper instead. \u201cWait, that\u2019s for math,\u201d my fianc\u00e9e said. \u201cWhy would someone write a history exam on math paper?\u201d\nAs with many a realization whose depth we don\u2019t recognize at the time that we have it, I just shrugged and said: \u201cI guess they can choose whichever paper they want.\u201d\nNow, having dwelled a little more on my own school days, I believe I, too, was free to pick my own paper. Rule-loving creature that I am , I don\u2019t recall ever completing a written exam on graph paper, but in theory, I could have. Mostly, however, the whole incident reminded me of how many freedoms we had in German high school in the early 2000s. There were no school uniforms. Everyone had their own backpack. We doodled on our pencil cases and our homework books. We wore crazy hairstyles . And we left copious notes in our textbooks. All of that was freedom. All of it helped us become more of who we were meant to be as individuals.\nYou may not have grown up in the most liberal of educational circumstances . But whether you did, didn\u2019t, or did but were socialized out of making the most of them, remember: Life sets exams for all of us, but you can pick your own paper. You can put an essay on quad paper, do calculations on ruled sheets, or draw a perfect rectangle on a blank page\u2014and though it may not feel like the most empowering act of defiance, writing on graph paper sure counts for a start.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: The Water Cathedral of Identity\n\n### Content: \nModern books are often littered with testimonials. My copy of Der Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse needs just one: \u201cThere are only few books which transform us, which give us courage to change our lives,\u201d French writer Frederic Beigbeder says on the back cover. \u201c Der Steppenwolf is one such book.\u201d\nSince I already loved Siddhartha , maybe I\u2019m just a sucker for Hesse, but when it comes to Steppenwolf , transform me it did. And while it sure gave me courage to change like Beigbeder suggests, perhaps even more importantly, it gave me permission to do so.\nThis novel about a depressed, torn man who rediscovers the joy of living is many things, but to me, first and foremost, it\u2019s an exploration of identity.\nHarry Haller starts out on the verge of suicide. He is deeply dissatisfied with life itself and his own in particular. Only once he meets the chirpy but mysterious Hermine, a woman who seems to live life to the fullest yet still be aware of all its existential conundrums, does he begin to change his point of view. Harry finally learns to dance. He attends night clubs and events and rediscovers the other sex. Many of his experiences end up being surreal. As a reader, you won\u2019t know what was real and what wasn\u2019t until the very end\u2014but by the final pages, you\u2019ll understand: Life is about laughter more so than about delivering a neatly compressible image of yourself to everyone else.\nThe book addresses the theme of identity head on more than once, one of the more memorable instances being that, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, \u201cwhile science insists we present only one orderly self to the public, actually, we each hold many selves within us.\u201d By his friends and mentors throughout the book, Harry is encouraged to let go of the civil self he clings to so desperately yet so unhappily, and once he does, he finds the freedom to reinvent himself at any moment rather enjoyable.\nI\u2019m not sure the book\u2019s powerful illustration of this journey can be made colorful any other way than by reading the book itself, and while I\u2019d like to try my hand at that some other time, for now, know the book\u2019s central theme is that identity is a meme\u2014and far from our best one.\nI\u2019ve thought about, written about, and tracked this phenomenon in the arts for a long time. It appears in the penultimate episode of Arcane . The Bourne movies are all over it . Jim Carrey is a remarkable example of someone who got the joke . Time and again, I encounter books, TV shows, and people who ask an innocent yet profound question: Who are we\u2014and why does that seem so important to begin with?\nIt took me five years of writing to fully claim the identity of \u201cbeing a writer.\u201d After five more years of feeling much more comfortable in my own skin, I concluded that \u201cyour identity is a cathedral made out of water.\u201d It looks much more precious than it is. If you dare\u2014if someone gives you permission\u2014you can snap your fingers and, swoosh, the whole thing collapses into a teacup. Then, you can start over, and while some towers will take time to build, some labels take a while to claim, you\u2019ll be able to raise other new structures as quickly as you crushed the old ones.\nIf you feel stuck in any way, shape, or form, read Der Steppenwolf . I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to do it justice in my own words, but perhaps all I need is to echo Frederic Beigbeder\u2019s: There are only few books which transform us, which give us both courage and permission to change our lives. Der Steppenwolf is one such book.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: A Circle of Teaching\n\n### Content: \nYesterday, I showed my fianc\u00e9e a bratwurst stall that I used to go to as a child when we went shopping in a certain town. Fresh rolls, lightly charred sausages\u2014still a classic! After the salesman handed over the goods, I looked around for ketchup and mustard. I conveniently found them beside the stall.\nThe dispenser was about one meter tall and, as it turned out, offered mustard, ketchup , and mayo to choose from. What was special about this one, however, was that you dosed the amount of sauce with your foot. Genius! Instead of wrestling with sausage rolls and napkins, and getting yourself dirty in the process, you just hold your hot dog up to the nozzle, tap a button on the floor, and voil\u00e0! The perfect line of mustard with zero hassle.\nThere was just one problem with this brilliant construction : People didn\u2019t recognize it. Shortly after us, another couple stepped up and stood puzzled in front of the dispenser. \u201cYou have to use your foot,\u201d I explained. \u201cAh, thanks,\u201d the man said. Once they knew how it worked, they, too, thought it was a rather clever way to offer condiments.\nAs the couple stood eating, discussing the dispenser, more people walked up. They tried squeezing the nozzles at the top directly to little effect, until the guy who I had just helped paid it forward: \u201cYou have to use your foot.\u201d \u201cAh, thanks,\u201d came the response. He looked at me and laughed. \u201cI guess that\u2019s the circle of life,\u201d I said.\nAfter we all went our way, I kept wondering how many people misunderstood the dispenser each day. How many times someone says, \u201cYou have to use your foot.\u201d And for how long this cycle will continue. Probably forever. And while this very much is the circle of life , I did realize something else: That circle is a circle of teaching. It\u2019s not just life and death, death and life. The old caring for the young until it\u2019s the youngs\u2019 turn to care for the old. It\u2019s also a matter of you teaching me, me teaching him, him teaching her, and then her teaching you.\nNever stop learning\u2014but don\u2019t forget to teach, too. Even if all you\u2019ll do is teach a stranger how to use the ketchup dispenser, you never know how far each lesson will go.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: How To Walk Away\n\n### Content: \nArcane is a critically acclaimed, animated TV series set in the League of Legends universe . Two sisters represent two warring factions of what is, essentially, the same city. Except overground, Piltover houses the rich in shiny houses and a prosperous environment, whereas underground, Zaun is marked by a lack of infrastructure\u2014and thus a public struggling with crime and drugs.\nTowards the end of the show, after each side and sister have had the upper hand more than once, Jinx, the younger of the two, finally finds herself in a Piltover prison cell. If only in her mind, her deceased mentor Silco appears with a last bit of advice on how everyone might finally see some peace : \u201cKilling is a cycle. We build our own prisons. Bars forged of oaths, codes, commitments. Walls of self-doubt and accepted limitation. We inhabit these cells, these identities, and call them \u2018us.'\u201d\nWhat the ghost from Jinx\u2019s past is hinting at is that each battle only lasts as long as both sides are willing to show up for it\u2014and that willingness usually comes from desperately wanting to prove a point about who we are. \u201cI thought I could break free by eliminating those I deemed my jailors,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut\u2026Jinx\u2026I think the cycle only ends when you find the will to walk away.\u201d\nWalking away is often a good option when it\u2019s painless. Sometimes even when the cost is great. But how do you do it? Silco offers an interesting blueprint: You just let go of that part of your identity. Yesterday, you were a soldier\u2014but yesterday is dead , and so today is as good a day as any to be a doctor, artist, or father instead. If you can see identity as a mirage, a cathedral made of nothing but water , you\u2019re free to dissolve every individual part of yours\u2014even the one you held on to so desperately until only minutes ago.\nIn the show, while Jinx hears her mentor\u2019s words, she interprets them in the most dramatic of ways. Eventually, it\u2019ll take someone else sacrificing a part of their identity to save her. But in the end, just like the creators of Arcane decided to call it quits after two monumental seasons, maybe this is one of the noblest reasons of all to walk away.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: The Humble Shooter\n\n### Content: \nAt one point in To Kill a Mockingbird , a dog with rabies slowly walks up to the house of our hero family, the Finches. After housekeeper Calpurnia promptly drags the kids, who discovered the threat, off the street, she calls for their dad, Atticus, to come home.\nSoon, Atticus returns with the sheriff in tow, and the two wait for the doomed animal to come within shooting range. As soon as it does, Atticus prompts the sheriff to take the shot , but the latter refuses. To the surprise of everyone watching, he hands the gun to Atticus. \u201cMr. Finch, this is a one-shot job,\u201d he says. Atticus claims he hasn\u2019t fired a gun in 30 years, and the two go back and forth on who should do what\u2019s necessary. Until, eventually, the sheriff just blares out: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Mr. Finch, look where he is! Miss and you\u2019ll go straight into the Radley house! I can\u2019t shoot that well and you know it!\u201d\nReluctantly, Atticus takes the rifle. The nearly 50-year-old lawyer walks into the middle of the street, takes off his glasses, whips up the gun to his shoulder in one swift motion, and before the mad dog can look around twice, he drops dead on the street. Within seconds, everyone is sad but safe .\nLater in the day, the kids Jem and Scout, who\u2019ve never seen their dad do anything remarkable, are still shocked at Atticus\u2019 hidden talent. They discuss it with Miss Maudie, a neighbor, and she explains how, even as a boy, \u201cOne-Shot Finch\u201d was \u201cthe deadest shot in Maycomb County.\u201d As the kids remain incredulous as to why Atticus would never have told him about his skill , she even leaves them with a useful bit of advice: \u201cPeople in their right minds never take pride in their talents.\u201d\nDuring the 2024 Olympics, the Turkish shooter Yusuf Dike\u00e7 went viral for his casual attire and pose while firing his pistol with one hand. At nearly 52 years old, he was even older than Atticus, and\u2014after winning the Silver medal\u2014Turkey\u2019s oldest Olympic medalist. He kind of appeared out of nowhere, and back to nowhere he went right after. He, too, was a humble shooter\u2014and whether he read the book or not, he sure seems to have heeded Miss Maudie\u2019s advice.\nShoot the mad dog if you have to, but remember: \u201cPeople in their right minds never take pride in their talents.\u201d<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: The Phone Will Fall Again\n\n### Content: \nFive years after my last one, I bought a new iPhone. I wasn\u2019t overly excited. There were three reasons.\nFirst, unlike my past devices, which all disintegrated after three years, this one still worked rather well. I only got the replacement so I could use the old one as a separate phone for my new job. It\u2019s a decent reason to get a new phone but not a great one.\nSecond, I try to use my phone as little as possible . So when I do, it\u2019s mostly sending messages, calling people, and browsing the web. The improved camera quality is always nice, but given how little of their potential I tend to unlock, new phones are often wasted on someone like me.\nThird, and this is the most deliberate, cultivated reason I wasn\u2019t too excited, I knew the phone would fall again. Just like my old one eventually dropped and got its first scratches, this one, too, would one day end up dented. As the zen story goes , \u201cthe cup is already broken.\u201d Enjoy it while it lasts, but don\u2019t get attached to it.\nThere is, however, one emotion I tried to lean into when buying my new phone: gratitude . I was grateful that I could buy an expensive phone without having to worry about the money too much\u2014even if it was for an only-okay reason, if I wouldn\u2019t end up using it all that much, if it would one day scratch and break just like my last one did.\nI still remember the first time my old phone fell. I had placed it onto my wallet at a restaurant table, and because of its smooth surface, it slid right down and off the side. There\u2019s always a bit of melancholy when the first blemish appears, but perhaps that\u2019s also why we call things \u201cbroken in\u201d\u2014now, they have fully arrived in our lives. One day, they\u2019ll break entirely, but for now, the phase of real usefulness has begun.\nEnjoy your shiny objects , but remember: The phone will fall again, and that\u2019s perfectly okay.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Life Is What We Do Next\n\n### Content: \nElecting a new pope is never easy, but in the movie Conclave , it appears to be impossible . The voting rounds of over 100 cardinals, locked away behind closed doors, are plagued by sexual scandals, bribery, and even Muslim acts of terror.\nOne by one, initially favored candidates fade away, and it all plays into the hands of the ultraconservative cardinal Goffredo Tedesco. At one point, he claims the papacy should go to someone \u201cwho fights these animals.\u201d For the first time, a quiet cardinal who arrived only at the last minute raises his voice.\nVincent Benitez, who spent his ministry in the Congo, Baghdad, and Kabul, calls Tedesco out: \u201cWhen you say we have to fight, what is it you think we\u2019re fighting?\u201d The real battle lies \u201cinside each and every one of us,\u201d Benitez explains. Having watched the conclave play out from the sidelines, his main observation is that \u201cthese last few days we have shown ourselves to be small, petty men, concerned only with ourselves, with Rome, with these elections, with power.\u201d\n\u201cBut things are not the Church,\u201d Benitez continues. \u201cThe Church is not tradition. The Church is not the past. The Church is what we do next.\u201d\nA long silence follows. No one wants to admit it yet, but Benitez\u2019 words left their mark. And by the next morning, when every cardinal holds yet another slip of paper in their hand, they still don\u2019t all agree, but they have learned one lesson: Electing a new pope is not impossible, but it will take a lot of humility, working together, and, as all good things that come out of the Church, faith to get it done.\nWhat struck me most about Benitez\u2019 speech, however, is that you could replace the word \u201cChurch\u201d not only with just about any other organization, but even with the word \u201clife,\u201d and it\u2019d still make perfect sense. We are not our lowest common denominator. We are not our greatest fear. And we are definitely not who we were yesterday . Whatever obstacle will drop into your path today, remember: Life is not how we got here. Life is what we do next.<|end_of_text|>"}

When my dad and I have been sitting at the dining table for too long, philosophizing, one might say, \u201cRhubarb!\u201d Then, we\u2019ll finally get up and go for our daily walk .\nThe German word for \u201crhubarb\u201d is \u201cRhabarber.\u201d More so than just describing a vegetable, it is also a common way of pointing out when someone is jabbering. It even sounds like \u201cblah blah,\u201d especially if you repeat it thrice for dramatic effect: \u201cRhabarber, Rhabarber, Rhabarber.\u201d In fact, there\u2019s a whole family of tongue twisters built around the word, and even a funny song describing \u201cBarbara\u2019s rhubarb bar.\u201d\nSo when my dad is annoyed at having the umpteenth meeting of the day , he might walk out of his office, roll his eyes, and say, \u201cRhabarber, Rhabarber.\u201d When a friend tells me to get to the point, they might cut me off with \u201cRhabarber!\u201d It\u2019s a decisive, not always friendly but mostly endearing way of reminding someone: \u201cHey. You\u2019re yapping. Let\u2019s get a move on.\u201d\nMy friend Mike says \u201c banana \u201d whenever he gets angry. Then, he eats one and calms down instead of yelling at his wife.

{"text":"### Title: The Pacifist Who Stuck to His Guns\n\n### Content: \nThe intro of Trigun , an anime from 1998, shows a badass guy with spiky blond hair on a distant, deserted planet, walking around in a cool red coat and slinging a massive gun. As soon as the show begins, however, all of the macho-action vibes fade away.\nWe see Vash helplessly running away from bandits trying to cash in on the 60 billion double-dollar bounty on his head. We see him chasing after girls and stuffing his face with donuts . And the more we get to know the dorky, child-loving, friendly, couldn\u2019t-hurt-a-fly Vash, the more we wonder: Is anything ever going to happen in this show? Of course, it eventually does\u2014because with such a fat price tag on him, bounty hunters of all shapes and sizes can never resist targeting Vash for too long.\nSoon, we learn that Vash is actually rather powerful. In fact, he can deal with almost any adversary in seconds. For some reason, however, he usually chooses not to. Vash only steps in when someone\u2019s about to get hurt, and, most of the time, the day ends with everyone home safe and sound. Here is a guy who could wipe out entire towns yet constantly talks about \u201clove and peace!\u201d\nNaturally, the people Vash befriends throughout the show are puzzled by his behavior. The two ladies from the insurance company tasked with tracking him down, for example, mistake him for someone else throughout several encounters until realizing they actually have found Vash. \u201cThe humanoid typhoon? A donut-loving guy like this? No way!\u201d\nOne of Vash\u2019s friends in particular, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a former bounty hunter\u2014and also a priest with a huge cross for a gun\u2014cannot parse Vash\u2019s attitudes to life. Wolfwood is used to shooting bad people in order to protect those he deems good. Seeing Vash refuse to do the same, even when life gets really, really dangerous, makes him question our hero\u2019s ideals, and not just in his head.\nIn the end, however, there is one trait above all that allows Vash to move everyone, first in their hearts and then to his side: stubbornness . Vash is so pigheaded, so unrelenting in his insistence on love, peace, and happiness, that, sooner or later, all of his friends come around\u2014if only for being so annoyed by his persistence, they throw up their arms and say, \u201cFine, we\u2019ll do it your way!\u201d That\u2019s both inspiring and, when someone aspires to ideals like Vash\u2019s, worth emulating.\nTrigun is a fun pastime but also a complex show that asks many questions about ethics, philosophy, and morality. It holds many a good lesson one can learn, but for me, the most memorable one was this: When you know you\u2019re on the right side of history, do what the humanoid typhoon would do, and stick to your guns . Sooner or later, the world will come around\u2014and even if they don\u2019t, at least you\u2019ll have stuck your neck out for what\u2019s right.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: A Farewell to Clubbing\n\n### Content: \nWhen my new co-worker told me she loved the Berlin nightlife, I tried to remember the last time I went to a club. It took me a solid ten minutes. I realized I had even been to one last year during a bachelor party\u2014but before then? No clue.\nThere was a time when I went out every weekend, sometimes twice. It used to be important to me. Now, it isn\u2019t. That\u2019s how life goes. Priorities shift.\nThere are still parts of the nightlife I enjoy to this day. I like dancing. I like EDM music. But I don\u2019t need to go to a club to enjoy them. I can do that at home all day long. So the unique aspects of the experience which make me \u201cme\u201d as \u201ca clubber,\u201d well, those I haven\u2019t lost. Perhaps they were always there, and the clubbing just emphasized them.\nUsually, our priorities change before we can notice. When we do, we might feel sad or at least nostalgic. We \u201clost\u201d something, after all. But did we, really? Think about it. Chances are, you\u2019ll find an aspect of your former self that\u2019s still alive and kicking \u2014and that won\u2019t go out of fashion like your past habits.\nYou are always you, and in everything you do, you\u2019ll reveal a few pieces of yourself.

Don\u2019t get sucked in too far, or you\u2019ll burn out quickly.\u201d It\u2019s true. Thankfully, I already did all of that in 2017.\nAfter first falling down the crypto rabbit hole, I\u2019d spend hours every day on Twitter, Youtube, and Telegram, soaking up information, learning everything that I could, trying to find the next big coin. But after a few months, the bull market ended, I didn\u2019t get filthy rich, and I realized: \u201cOkay, you don\u2019t have to do that. Life will go on either way.\u201d But bull markets come and go\u2014and they\u2019re all intoxicating for different reasons. So \u201c I\u2019ve done this before \u201d isn\u2019t the real reason I\u2019m not worried about my new job becoming all-consuming.\nIn 2017, I was a college student. Working full-time for myself to earn an okay-ish income, but still also a college student. I had time. I was single. My vision for my writing wasn\u2019t very clear. I often lived day-to-day, and when you do, it\u2019s easy for any particular wave of life to come in and sweep you away.\nToday, I\u2019m an engaged man. I live with my fianc\u00e9e, and my rent is twice as high. I know exactly which books I want to write, and I know how long it\u2019ll take me . In other words: I don\u2019t have time for shenanigans. Distraction is a luxury, and with a full-time job, I can only afford it in small doses. This might sound like it creates pressure, and sometimes, it does. But mostly, it feels liberating. It makes me proud of every minute I spend writing my next book\u2014and it makes it easy to close my work laptop when the day is over.\nI\u2019ve long believed that when we\u2019re young, we value complete freedom too highly. That\u2019s why I worked a lot in my 20s, and it gave me a career foundation that can last a lifetime. Some of my high school friends also settled down quite early in their lives. They got married, built houses, had kids. Floating through life like a butterfly in the wind has its moments but, to me, it seems it\u2019s never a bad time to be anchored. Life consists entirely of tradeoffs . Sooner or later, we\u2019re all forced to make the hard ones. There is no shame in facing that game when you\u2019re young, in playing it early and getting better at it rather than trying to escape it.\nIt\u2019s ironic but almost typical, the kind of joke life likes to play on us: If you want to see how high you can fly, you actually need an anchor\u2014and you\u2019ll spread your wings as soon as you pick the right one.<|end_of_text|>"}

There are favorites. There are plots. And everyone thinks their candidate is the right one. So, instead of just endorsing someone, he says:\n\u201cThere is one sin which I have come to fear above all others: Certainty. Certainty is the great enemy of unity. Certainty is the deadly enemy of tolerance. Even Christ was not certain at the end. \u2018My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\u2019 he cried out in his agony at the ninth hour on the cross. Our faith is a living thing precisely because it walks hand-in-hand with doubt. If there was only certainty and no doubt, there would be no mystery\u2014and therefore no need for faith. Let us pray that God will grant us a Pope who doubts.\u201d\nCertainty is easy. It\u2019s comforting. And you can pick it from whichever source you like these days. For every single thing you hope to believe, there is a salesperson somewhere on the internet, praying the exact gospel you seek.\nTo doubt is to live in the fog. To exist between opinions rather than be made up of them. It can feel uneasy \u2014but also liberating. As long as you keep the door open to the possibility you might be wrong, a better idea is always just one step away.\nThe Church, too, needs better ideas. That\u2019s what it hopes for from every next pope. Will it be one who doubts? If every cardinal were to do so, the answer would be a guaranteed \u201cYes.\u201d Elected official or not, choose doubt over certainty\u2014for the most beautiful blossoms are usually the offspring of humble minds coming together.<|end_of_text|>"}

Somehow, the Deutsche Bahn manages to shrink my transfer time down to a minute or two with an oddly impressive frequency. Eleven minutes become seven, become five, become two. And off you go!\nYesterday, I was once again in this situation. My 17-minute lead had vanished. I arrived at 5:33 on platform 10. The other train? Leaving at 5:35 from platform 2. Spoiler alert: I ran like a madman. Heavy backpack. Sorta heavy suitcase. Puffy jacket. Fun! With my heart rate at 200 , I plopped down into my seat. Made it! As soon as I\u2019d sat down, I heard the announcer: \u201cDue to trains ahead of us, our departure will be delayed by a few minutes.\u201d Ahh, the usual. Good one, Deutsche Bahn! And of course that delay didn\u2019t show up in the app I updated frantically every 15 seconds during arrival. Argh, this company!\nIn the last ten minutes before my sprint, however, still on the other train, I had a moment of clarity. I knew I\u2019d have to decide: Do I run or do I let it go? I could go for it and potentially still miss my connection, or I could stroll leisurely into the arrival hall, grab a coffee, and wait an hour for the next one. I remembered talking to my friend Maarten about this years ago: \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do people run for the bus? Just take the next one !\u201d There are some lifestyle factors here, of course, but I remember agreeing with him back then. I believe I still do and always have. But then why am I running for the train?\nTo run or not to run. To chase life or let it come to you. It\u2019s a choice\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. I\u2019m glad I made it deliberately in this instance, but I\u2019m also not sure I want to keep picking the same option.\nReflection happens in the space between opportunity and action. It\u2019s beautiful when you get to see it in real-time and marvelous when you consciously decide to change course. Use that space. Make choices, and move forward\u2014just like a train, even when it\u2019s yet again delayed.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Good People\n\n### Content: \nThose are the ones we seek, aren\u2019t they? But what does \u201cgood\u201d mean? Three examples, one lesson.\nYesterday, I accompanied my dad to a local political event. We never do this, but he knew the organizer, and a member of parliament from the conservative party showed up. A woman from the other end of Germany, she spoke with passion and empathy. She came prepared with numbers and arguments. I can\u2019t even vote in this particular district, but man, she made a great case. It was such a breath of fresh air to see a real person act like a real politician for once. \u201cThank god. They still have good people,\u201d I thought.\nEarlier in the same day, I had a coffee chat with a fellow writer. He also happened to be my new colleague . It was the twelfth coffee chat in the last two weeks, and I haven\u2019t left a single one without a solid piece of advice, a helpful document to read, or a recommendation of who else to talk to. \u201cWow,\u201d I keep thinking. \u201cThese are all good people!\u201d\nAt the very end of this very long day , I opened my inbox. There was an email from a book summary company who\u2019s considering buying my Youtube channel. We\u2019ve gone back and forth almost 20 times already. They ask for information. I send them screenshots. And repeat. She thanked me for \u201cthe comprehensive overview and the effort you\u2019ve put into sharing these insights\u201d and promised to get back again this week. I trust that she will. \u201cThanks again for your openness and for sharing such detailed background information,\u201d she closed her email. \u201cWonderful,\u201d I thought. \u201c No bullshit . Just all cards on the table, and \u2018let\u2019s figure this out together.\u2019 There are some good people in this space.\u201d\nWe think \u201cgood\u201d means \u201ccharming,\u201d \u201cskilled,\u201d or \u201caccomplished.\u201d But none of those traits matter when someone is acting only in their own best interest. Good people are good because they keep choosing to do the right thing. Be good\u2014and then find more good people.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Infinity and Eternity\n\n### Content: \nInfinity asked his sister Eternity: \u201cDo you ever get bored?\u201d \u201cAll the time,\u201d Eternity said. \u201cHow about you?\u201d\n\u201cNever,\u201d Infinity replied. \u201cHow could I? There\u2019s so much to do! So much to see, feel, and experience! I want to climb Mount Everest. I want to be a drummer. I want to live in a monastery. Don\u2019t you want to try them all? \u201c\n\u201cI did,\u201d Eternity said, \u201cand I can tell you that, after a while, they\u2019re all the same. There is nothing new under the sun.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? How can you say that?!\u201d Infinity looked incredulous. \u201cFlying a plane, surfing a wave, kissing the love of your life, how could these possibly be the same?\u201d\n\u201cOneness lies not in what you do, little brother. It lies in who you are underneath, and whether you can bring them to any occasion. When you live every day from the shining light that is your true self, how you spend your time no longer matters.\u201d\nInfinity had never heard his sister talk like this before. \u201cWait, wait, wait. Hold on. What are you even saying? Who is this \u2018them\u2019 you are talking about? And what does it mean to \u2018live from the shining light?\u2019 Why have you not told me about any of this until now?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, Infinity, I\u2019ve waited a long time,\u201d Eternity said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve spent endless lifetimes waiting. I just figured today is as good a day as any to see if you are ready.\u201d\n\u201cReady for what? !\u201d Infinity half-shouted.\n\u201cYou asked about \u2018them,'\u201d Eternity said, completely ignoring her little brother\u2019s question. \u201cMaybe an example will help. You said you wanted to be a drummer, right?\u201d\nDoing as little siblings do, Infinity momentarily forgot about his consternation. \u201cRight! Drummers are cool. They provide the lifeblood of music: rhythm. Playing their instrument is a workout. They can dress however they want. And they can be rockstars! Tour all over the world, be famous, make lots of money\u2014what\u2019s not to love?\u201d\nEternity smiled. \u201cOkay. Drummer it is. Let\u2019s say you are one. Better yet, you achieve all the things you\u2019ve just mentioned! By age 30, you are the most famous drummer in the world. Now what would you do next?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d keep drumming! I would continue to tour, record new music, and play a gig in every country of the world. I would enjoy all the money I am making, throw lots of parties, and treat my friends whenever we hang out.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Eternity said. \u201cLet\u2019s say that keeps you busy for another 20 years. You are 50 now. You\u2019ve released 20 platinum-certified albums. You are a bazillionaire. Your house is so big that all your friends and family can comfortably live in it, and your parties take social media by storm every year. What then?\u201d\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d Infinity murmured. As he sat there thinking, Eternity could see he was slowly struggling to come up with more ideas. Making good use of the break, she continued: \u201cBy the way, there is a twist to this example. Two, actually. First, as a drummer, you must play the drums every day. After all, drumming is what defines you as a drummer. Agreed?\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Infinity nodded. \u201cThat just makes sense. What\u2019s the other twist?\u201d\n\u201cSecond, you will live to be one thousand and one years old.\u201d\n\u201cOne thousand years?!\u201d Infinity exclaimed. \u201cGeez that\u2019s long.\u201d\n\u201cOne thousand and one ,\u201d Eternity corrected him. \u201cBut yes, that is the deal.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Infinity said with a shrug. At least the interruption had given him time to think. In the second half of his normal human lifespan, he wanted to start a charity teaching kids about rhythm and music via the drums. He also intended to pioneer a bunch of new drumming techniques and spread them far and wide among drummers all over the world\u2014until his unique move set, \u201cthe Infinity strokes,\u201d would be the bread and butter of every aspiring drummer.\n\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take for these projects to reach their full potential?\u201d Eternity asked.\n\u201cProbably until I\u2019m 100 years old,\u201d Infinity said.\n\u201cWell, only 901 years to go then! What now?\u201d\nThey went back and forth like this for a while. Infinity kept squeezing his brain for more ideas, and Eternity kept prodding. To Infinity\u2019s credit, he came up with more things to do than any human ever could, but with around 300 years to go, he let out a big sigh. Visibly exhausted, he admitted: \u201cI\u2019m tapped out sis. I can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d\n\u201cSo? What then?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What then?'\u201d Infinity said, slightly aggravated. \u201cNothing then! I\u2019m done! I give up!\u201d\nBut Eternity wouldn\u2019t let him quit the game. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine, no need to shout. But what will you do for the remaining 283 years?\u201d\n\u201cWooaaargh, really sis?\u201d Infinity went. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna keep doing this? Fine!\u201d As he vented his frustration, a flash of genius hit him. With a mischievous grin, he announced: \u201cWell, I guess from here on out, I would just keep drumming.\u201d\n\u201cAha!\u201d Eternity exclaimed. \u201cInteresting.\u201d Not one to let her little brother off easy, however, she continued: \u201cWhat do you think would happen once, after all these centuries of struggle and success, you kept drumming for another ten years?\u201d\n\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Infinity scratched his head. \u201cNot much, probably. I might get better. I might get worse. In any case, my style would continue to change, but that\u2019s about it. What do you think, Eternity?\u201d\n\u201cSounds about right,\u201d Eternity went. \u201cWhat about 20 more years? Or 50? Or even 100?\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Now Infinity was intrigued again. He took his time. He really thought about this one. Finally, he said: \u201cI figure if all I did was play the drums for that long, everything else would slowly fade away. My past as a rockstar. My accomplishments. Even my work with the charity. There would only be drumming.\u201d\n\u201cRight. What effect might that have on someone?\u201d\n\u201cHmm, I\u2019d be bored a lot. On some days, I probably wouldn\u2019t feel like it. But of course, I\u2019d keep drumming anyway. On other days, I might feel on top of the world, even when no one could hear my drumming. I guess it would all just\u2026come and go. I would have to learn to enjoy just drumming . To accept every day exactly as it is. Boring? Perhaps. Mundane? Definitely. But at least full of drumming .\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Eternity commended her little brother. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the more I think about it, the more it seems that it wouldn\u2019t even matter whether I was drumming, climbing, or surfing. In a life like that, you could replace the drumming with any activity.\u201d\n\u201cBingo!\u201d Eternity broke into a big smile. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018them.\u2019 Congratulations! You\u2019ve just discovered your true self.\u201d\n\u201cHuh? My true self is a bored drummer?\u201d Infinity looked puzzled.\n\u201cNo, silly, your true self accepts every day as it is. It is not worried about what the tide of time may or may not bring\u2014because it is focused on enjoying every moment as it occurs. Your true self does not care about fame or money or pleasure or status. It is not fussed about its legacy, and it is not concerned when it will die.\nYour true self is simply present, and in its presence manifests its eternity. In every moment you are present, you are truly here. Presence is the ultimate proof you have lived. It doesn\u2019t have to be written down anywhere. Eternity never forgets. I never forget. Your presence, your full engagement in the reality of life, is enough.\nOnce you have that, once you bring \u2018them\u2019\u2014your true self\u2014to the table, nothing else matters.\u201d\n\u201cWow!\u201d That\u2019s all Infinity could say. Then, he was quiet. At first, it seemed to Eternity her words were eating away at her brother, but, eventually, she realized it was him chewing on what she had said. She decided to let him ruminate. For a long time, not quite an eternity but a good while, the siblings merely sat there, together in silence, yet each walking their own inner path.\nSuddenly, Infinity perked up. \u201cHey, Eternity, what about that one extra year? You said I\u2019d live to be not one thousand but one thousand and one years old. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d\n\u201cAhh, you noticed. I\u2019m glad.\u201d Eternity was smiling again. \u201cThat one was merely for appreciation.\u201d\n\u201cAppreciation?\u201d\n\u201cWell, even in our imaginary example, it took you 717 years to find your true self. You only got to savor it for 283 years. Or maintain it, rather. You see, whatever you can find, you can also lose . It is wonderful to know your true self. To be aware of your eternal presence underneath. But you must still choose that presence every day. If you don\u2019t bring it, if you get swept away by externalities or your own inner battles, that day might be lost. It\u2019s an honorable quest, this search for presence, and whoever maintains it for a lifetime deserves to enjoy the fruits of their labor, don\u2019t you think? That\u2019s why I gave you that extra year. To not just be present but appreciate your journey in all its depth. And to find peace in it ending\u2014for though it is only me, only Eternity who calls, one day, every individual presence ends.\u201d\n\u201cExcept mine, I guess!\u201d Infinity broke the solemn mood that had descended upon the siblings. Eternity chuckled. \u201cExcept yours, of course. You are Infinity, after all.\u201d\n\u201cJokes aside, that was beautiful sis. Thank you for teaching me. Sounds like a real gift, that one year. In fact, you\u2019ve made me curious. I still can\u2019t quite imagine how it feels. What it\u2019s like to truly go through that experience. The ups. The downs. The swaying between different goals and ideals. The chases. The losses. The near-misses. And then, in the end, finding your true self. Real presence, and living it as best as one can, every single day. You know, maybe I should start my own, one-thousand-and-one-year-journey.\u201d\n\u201cSo you are ready,\u201d Eternity mumbled, more to herself than her brother. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Infinity asked. \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Eternity cleared her throat. \u201cI was just wondering which activity you might pick. How you\u2019ll begin your journey, I mean. Any ideas?\u201d\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be a drummer,\u201d Infinity said.\nThere was a pause between the two. It was long but not uncomfortable in the slightest\u2014a moment where clarity settles in two minds simultaneously, and where words are no longer needed\u2014the kind of telepathy only siblings know.\nEternity was the first to speak. \u201cAlright then,\u201d she said, only allowing herself a half-grin. Inside, she was giggling with joy, but she could tell Infinity was serious, and the last thing she wanted to do was discourage her little brother.\nThe next morning, Infinity started drumming, and, for the first time, Eternity wasn\u2019t waiting for anything in particular. She grabbed a chair, sat down, and started watching. Legend has it that\u2019s where they still are today. Infinity and Eternity. One drumming, one watching\u2014both ever-present, basking in the shining light that is being one\u2019s true self.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Full Pockets\n\n### Content: \nI\u2019m about to go on my first business trip as an employee . Doing my usual \u201cwhat do I have on me?\u201d check before I leave, I realized: I now carry even more stuff in my pockets than usual. There are my phone, my keys, and my wallet. But now there\u2019s also my work phone and my Airpods. It makes me feel a bit\u2026bulky. So I guess some things will have to go into my backpack.\nIt\u2019s funny. Even the small items we carry around our waist, or perhaps in our handbag, require balance. You\u2019ll rarely venture out empty-handed, but you also don\u2019t want to leave so loaded up, you\u2019ve got no space to pick up any quarter you might serendipitously discover.\nGravity applies to all of us , but there\u2019s a reason weight is something we can feel: When we shoulder too much of it, we\u2019re meant to take some of it off.

Get one idea to stick in your mind , and you\u2019re golden.\nThe thing about noticing the details, however, is that you have to be present in order to do it. You only get one chance to meet each new coworker for the first time. What do you pick up on in that first 15 minutes? What sticks afterwards? If the answer is \u201cnothing,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re boring. Chances are, you just didn\u2019t listen all that closely .\nIf you were present, however, you can revisit a good deal of the conversation. Maybe you\u2019ll even find additional points you\u2019ll want to write down. With people, remembering one thing will help you start the next chat. \u201cIs the new baby cam still working?\u201d \u201cHow was the museum? \u201d \u201cDid you meet that guy in the end?\u201d In meetings, it can be enough to open a loop in your mind. Chances are, it\u2019ll stay open until whatever needs to be done is done.\nLife\u2019s demands can feel daunting\u2014but since everyone feels that way, usually, the bar is not that high.

{"text":"### Title: Dosed Communication\n\n### Content: \nAfter I came back from my business trip, I was exhausted. It had only been 40 hours, but with much time on the move, little sleep, and lots of information to process\u2014all on top of actual work\u2014I felt I had hit my cap for the week .\nThankfully, the day after my return was Friday. I asked my manager to cancel our weekly check-in and said I\u2019d take it easy in the morning, then start the day a bit later. She agreed, but I realized: Communication is often tricky because you don\u2019t know how to dose it.\nWith your loved ones, it\u2019s easy: You tell them everything . They get as close as anyone can get to having the full picture of your life, and so, hopefully, most of the time, they\u2019ll understand how you feel and why you do what you do. But what do you do with acquaintances, coworkers, your boss, and other weak ties?\nI could have told my boss about my sleeping issues in the last few weeks, about all of my little health issues from a probably weakened immune system, and on and on. But is that the right measure of information? Or is it sufficient for her to know: Nik needs rest? Given her busy schedule and that she had seen me in person just yesterday, I opted for the latter, and I think it was fine in this case.\nBut what about next time? I might have to add more color . Or less. Multiply this estimation task several times over, and you have the average demand for you to dose your communication on a weekly basis. It\u2019s hard, and sometimes we get it wrong. When that happens, the best we can do is follow up and course-correct. \u201cSorry, look, this is what I meant.\u201d Okay, now we\u2019re talking. Literally!\nThink about how much you\u2019ll say to whom at which time. Dosed communication is a challenge, but that\u2019s exactly what makes it a service to others .<|end_of_text|>"}

{"text":"### Title: An Answerless World\n\n### Content: \nA recurring theme of my 30s has been realizing how clueless I am about most things. In my 20s, I seemed to have more answers. The answers, of course, came almost exclusively from other people. It was naive to latch on to them, but at least it was easy. It helped me live with conviction , if only ever for a short period of time.\nWhat\u2019s frustrating about living by other people\u2019s answers is that, sooner or later, those answers will always let you down. I did get burned out from that. Eventually, I always found a fatal flaw in this mentor or that guru. So one day, I concluded heroes were also just people and stopped following any template in particular.\nThe flip side is that I\u2019m now as clueless as everybody else in navigating this life, and that, too, is challenging. It is also\u2026just life. There are no answers. Nobody knows where the stock market will go, whether this election or that one will be good for the future of a country, or how they can do a great job at work without messing up. There\u2019s no one right way to raise your kids, no perfect diet, and no meaning of life except the one you choose for yourself . That\u2019s why being an adult is scary.\nWhat I do know is that it\u2019s okay to be scared, that the future is less frightening when you realize you\u2019re not the only one facing the unknown, and that, in the end, asking good questions is more important than obsessing over answers which can never last to begin with.\nStart with here . Start with now . Take one breath, one step, and learn something for tomorrow. It\u2019s an answerless world we live in, but that\u2019s one of the many parts that makes it a beautiful one \u2013if only we learn to coexist with the unknown .<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: From an Eternal Point of View\n\n### Content: \nOne word which repeatedly grabbed me in Hermann Hesse\u2019s Der Steppenwolf was \u201c eternity .\u201d Hesse used it in a strange but comforting way. As if to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s always eternity!\u201d And even though eternity is not something accessible to us, every time I read about it in the book, it still felt soothing to think about it. Odd, isn\u2019t it?\nAs it turns out, philosophy has reserved a dedicated term for this very phenomenon: sub specie aeternitatis . Translated from Latin, it roughly means \u201cfrom an eternal point of view.\u201d The idea is to get us to look at life and ourselves more objectively, but also to find inspiration and peace by taking a cosmic rather than an earthly perspective.\nThe term goes back to Baruch Spinoza , a man who, against all odds , spoke critically of all religions in the 17th century. To Spinoza, god and nature were the same. \u201cDon\u2019t separate life into boxes,\u201d his work says. \u201cIt\u2019s all one and the same, and we should love and appreciate it all.\u201d What an enlightened way to think\u2014and a main character of the Enlightenment he became indeed.\nWhen your toe is itchy, take an eternal point of view. If you feel anxious about work tomorrow, take an eternal point of view. And when life seems to hold too many doors closed for you, take an eternal point of view. Inhale right now, but remember: Sub specie aeternitatis, it\u2019s all a drop in the ocean, and the best reaction is to smile .<|end_of_text|>"}

A friend happens to live there, and his girlfriend kindly brought me a bar while she was in town. \u201cTell me what you think,\u201d he texted me, \u201cbut I believe you and I will agree.\u201d\nBased on what you can see on social media, you\u2019d think the chocolate was filled with liquid gold . The product gets hundreds of millions of views. Knockoffs abound around the globe. Even in Germany, I already saw Dubai cr\u00eapes, Dubai cake, and Dubai donuts. One person tried to smuggle 45 kilograms into the country .\nSo how does it taste? It\u2019s good. Very good, even. But it\u2019s still chocolate\u2014with pistachio and some crunchy bits inside, sure. But \u201cjust\u201d chocolate nonetheless. Maybe that\u2019s the spoiled German in me, who\u2019s used to Milka, Kinder products, and the likes of Lindt and L\u00e4derach from Switzerland. But like my friend suggested, we agreed: It\u2019s cool, but not the-world-must-lose-its-head-cool .\nThere is, however, one reason why I enjoyed the chocolate more than any ordinary bar: It was a gift from my friend. I did not expect it, yet one Sunday, I sat there, holding it in my hand. It\u2019s the kind of magic even 100 million views can\u2019t work\u2014but that, unlike those views, lingers long after the masses and the taste of the chocolate have gone.\nPerhaps, instead of wondering, \u201cWhich chocolate should I eat next?\u201d we should try a different question: \u201cWhom do I want to gift the next bar to?<|end_of_text|>"}

They were the toughest Pok\u00e9mon trainers in the game, and you better came prepared. In fact, you had to pass a whole set of separate trials along Victory Road just to get there.\nWhenever you arrive at the Elite Four, however long you\u2019ve been playing, there\u2019s always a bit of dialogue allowing you to reflect on how far you\u2019ve come. \u201cWow, I made it. Top Four. Unbelievable!\u201d\nYesterday, I opened my productivity app . It has a leaderboard. You can sort by highest scores on various time frames, like the current week, month, or all-time performance. I flipped to the all-time view , and there I was: top four. Wow. Unbelievable!\nThe app has been around for five years. I\u2019ve used it for around 14 months\u2014but from the first day onwards, I\u2019ve tracked at least some, usually most, of my work sessions every day. I don\u2019t know who else made it to the top of the leaderboard when. But I have seen plenty of people come and go .\n440 days of consistency. That sounds like a lot, but is it? In the grand scheme of things, 440 days pass quickly. Rack up a few points every day, however, and your score will keep climbing\u2014just like a dedicated Pok\u00e9mon trainer , taking the last steps up the Indigo Plateau , realizing only at the top: \u201cOh. Elite Four. Already?!\u201d\nDays played with your children; pages in a book; coins racked up in a wallet. Keep going a little every day. Before you know it, you\u2019ll have reached the top four.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: The Worst Pain Is Fear\n\n### Content: \nThe dentist is a great place to practice. Patience . Courage . Trust . But most of all: avoiding needless suffering.\nYesterday, I went there to change a filling. \u201cWe can do it without anesthesia,\u201d she said. As I lay there, listening to the drill, thinking about something else, I suddenly realized: I\u2019m as stiff as a floorboard. I was tensing the muscles in my shoulders, arms, and legs. \u201cWhy am I so on edge?\u201d I wondered.\nOn the surface, everything seemed fine. But underneath, I could sense I was worried, worried that, any second now, the drill might hit a nerve\u2014and then I\u2019d feel an intense surge of pain. \u201cBut wait a minute: If I stay this tight throughout the entire procedure, I\u2019ll be in pain no matter what happens. Can\u2019t I just relax until any potential agony actually arrives?\u201d I tried that. It helped. My muscles loosened a bit. But every now and then, I could feel the anxiety coming back, and I once again had to remind myself: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any pain yet. So relax.\u201d Naturally, no pain ever came.\nIf actual hurt was the only kind we suffered, the world would be a very different place. You\u2019d go to the dentist, scream perhaps once, most likely zero times, and go home. Instead, we wait for torment that never comes and, in the waiting, torment ourselves more thoroughly than life ever would .\n\u201cWe suffer more often in imagination than in reality,\u201d Seneca wrote nearly 2,000 years ago. Be it at the dentist, the office, or on a first date, it\u2019s still true: The worst pain is not pain. The worst pain is fear\u2014so let\u2019s only cross the bridge of suffering once we come to it.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Different vs. Better\n\n### Content: \nDavid Rowland wanted a better chair . It took him eight years to invent one. Then, plenty of rejections. Finally, a man named Davis Allen gave Rowland a chance: He ordered 17,000 of his 40\/4 chairs for a university campus his firm was designing.\n50 years later, it all seems obvious: Which company wouldn\u2019t want a chair that stacks only four feet tall when you pile 40 of them on top of one another? But initially, different just seemed different, not better.\nRowland knew what he was doing. He wanted \u201cbetter,\u201d and he was willing to cycle through \u201cdifferent\u201d as many times as he needed. In a 1965 interview , he admitted as much, leaving behind a maxim for us which might be even better than his chair: \u201cDifferent is not always better, but better is always different.\u201d\nOur default approach to \u201cbetter\u201d is \u201c more .\u201d After we realize \u201cdifferent\u201d is the way to go, we often still stray. It takes a thoughtful, deliberate kind of \u201cdifferent\u201d to land on \u201cbetter.\u201d And even once we do, it may still require years of rejection and a stranger giving us a trust advance before the world can see: \u201cAhh, this is the \u2018better\u2019 we\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent\u201d is hard\u2014but worth it. \u201cMore\u201d is a socially acceptable dead end. \u201cDifferent\u201d offers no guarantees, but it\u2019s the only road that might lead to \u201cbetter.\u201d Choose different. Try for better .<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Enlist Chance as an Ally\n\n### Content: \nIf anything could happen, it might as well be something good. That\u2019s one of my mottos .\nIn a chapter titled \u201cRoll the Dice\u201d in his book Creative Doing , my friend Herbert Lui transfers the idea to being creative: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever experiencing blockage or a sense of stuckness on a decision, try opening the door to chance in order to support your creative work,\u201d he writes.\nSometimes, a calculated gamble just might point you in the right direction, Herbert believes. Instead of continuing to stare at a wall , why not throw something at it? Flip the dictionary to any page, play with a random name generator, or toss some coins onto a table and start with whatever pattern they land in, Herbert suggests.\nWhen it comes to work projects, you may want to ask someone on a completely different team for an outside perspective. Stuck on bad first dates? Go somewhere you\u2019d never go. A violin concert, perhaps, or a pottery class. Even for your energy, a bit of entropy can help on occasion. Maybe staying up late for once will make you feel more energized, not less.\nNo matter the arena, the point remains: \u201cIf you want to make fewer decisions, enlist chance as an assistant,\u201d Herbert says. Fortuna is a goddess , not a creature of the underworld, and for good reason: She wants to be on our side. Will we relinquish our stubbornness and let her? The right time only we can determine, but sooner or later, we should.\nSee chance as an ally, not an enemy. After all, if anything could happen, it might as well be something good.<|end_of_text|>"}

{"text":"### Title: The Next Breath Is Enough\n\n### Content: \nAs I was lying awake at 6 AM this morning, hoping for another hour of sleep, I tried to focus on my breath. It helps whenever I can manage to stay with it. Unfortunately, that\u2019s rare. Thoughts follow thoughts , and, before I know it, it\u2019s time to get up .\nOne reason might be that, often, I doubt my method instead of using it. I take a few deep breaths and go: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this working?\u201d This morning, my answer was new: \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t believe in it working. I have to believe that focusing on each next breath is enough. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll always jump on another thought to justify my existence .\u201d\nI spent some time encouraging myself to hold fast to the idea. But, inevitably, I reflected more, and I realized: Actually, \u201cthe next breath is enough\u201d is not something I must believe\u2014it\u2019s something I merely need to accept . After all, I have 33 years of physical evidence that it\u2019s always been true. There\u2019s nothing else I\u2019ve been doing as consistently throughout my entire life. Neither have you, of course. Even food, water, and sleep come second to breathing. So it\u2019s not just a comforting idea. It\u2019s the absolute, undeniable truth: The next breath is enough.\nAcceptance also isn\u2019t easy, but it has a different feel to it than trying to will yourself into belief. That, too, I found comforting. \u201cAhh, yes. I can get cosy around this. The next breath is enough.\u201d I didn\u2019t fall asleep again, but I did find more rest . And if I wake up at night again today? Maybe I\u2019ll remember that the next breath is enough and, this time, drift back to sleep.

{"text":"### Title: Heading Out for a Bit\n\n### Content: \nSamurai Champloo is an anime classic set in Japan\u2019s Edo period, a time of shoguns , samurai, and strict social order. The story follows three unlikely friends: Fuu, a young waitress from a teahouse, Mugen, a short-tempered outlaw, and Jin, a quiet, disgraced samurai, aka ronin.\nLooking for \u201cthe samurai who smells of sunflowers,\u201d the trio stumbles into all kinds of adventures. In one episode , they end up in a village tormented by a \u201ctsujigiri,\u201d a rogue samurai randomly attacking\u2014and, in this case, killing\u2014others. This particular tsujigiri has been going after the best swordsman in the area, and, as it happens, both Mugen and Jin can more than hold their own with a blade .\nNever one to shy away from a challenge, Mugen is most eager to encounter the tsujigiri. One night, while following a trail of clues to a sake bar, he finds him. For the first time in the show, it appears Mugen is outmatched. Thankfully, a bunch of villagers come to his rescue. \u201cAt the next full moon, same place!\u201d the tsujigiri yells as he runs away.\nEven if it was his own, Mugen has tasted blood, and so, for the next month, he trains like a madman. He works on his handstand and jumping skills. He practices with his sword. He even lugs a heavy Buddha statue up and down the stairs. Time flies by, and the next full moon arrives.\nAs the trio is busy with their usual evening activities, Mugen suddenly gets up, picks up his sword, and walks off. \u201cWell, I\u2019m heading out for a bit,\u201d he says. No one dares say what they actually think , but Fuu reminds him: \u201cHey, you haven\u2019t forgotten, have you? You\u2019re gonna help me look for the samurai who smells of sunflowers, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah, I know,\u201d Mugen goes. Even the quiet Jin feels compelled to pitch in: \u201cIf someone is gonna kill you, it\u2019s gonna be me, got it?\u201d The usual banter is met with the usual response: \u201cWho do you think you are, my wife or something?\u201d And with that, Mugen strolls into an unknown future.\nLife drops us at difficult crossroads. Even when we\u2019re not alone in facing them, sometimes it\u2019s easier to not draw out the worst-case scenario . \u201cDon\u2019t paint the devil on the wall,\u201d we say in Germany. If everyone already knows, why dwell on the conclusion? Pretending a fateful day is the same as every other can be a way of letting our loved ones know: No matter what happens, nothing between us is going to change.\nWill Mugen defeat his challenger? There is only one way to find out. But even before we do, we already know: In not breaking character , his friends have shown they truly care for him\u2014and they\u2019ll be there regardless of what comes next.<|end_of_text|>"}

The sad part is not missing out on one of them. It\u2019s that this scenario has happened to me hundreds of times. Inevitably, I\u2019ll sit on a call, and, sooner or later, there comes the pitch. \u201cAhh, here it is\u2026\u201d\nIt\u2019s fair to make calculated moves in business.

In fact, he enjoyed the gift of vision for the first 68 years of his life. Once he developed cataracts, however, the sense he relied most on to make his art began to darken\u2014and so did his paintings.\nThe painter had lived a slow life in the countryside since his 40s. His favorite subjects were the plants in his garden . By the time his vision began to fade, he had been painting the same themes for a decade. On some days, despair caught hold of him. \u201cUseless old fool!\u201d he denounced himself as he slashed, painted over, and burned some of his works. Yet, on most days, he simply continued painting.\nAs the years went by, his sight ebbed and flowed. Near his 80s, he received a final request from his government: Paint your flowers on large canvases, so we may install them in large halls for the world to see. He painted some. He destroyed some. But in the end, he furnished over 40 large paintings of lilies swimming in the water.\nBy the time the painter closed his eyes for the last time, he was 86 years old. He had painted the same subject, water lilies, more than 250 times over the course of 30 years\u2014and those marked just 10% of his body of work. He had also painted people, train stations, and hay stacks.\nAfter his death, the government exhibited some of his works. People from all over the world marveled at the beautiful flowers on the walls. He had been a prolific artist , no doubt. But the water lilies\u2014they stuck. Was it the 30 years of dedication? Or the struggle against his waning eyesight?\nWhatever it was, even 100 years after his passing, anyone who witnesses his art can feel it: Via the indelible intention of his life, Claude Monet , the painter who couldn\u2019t see, proved a fellow French artist right: \u201cIt is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\u201d<|end_of_text|>"}

And if you\u2019re a designer, video maker, or data analyst? Forget about it. You\u2019ll have to choose carefully from the start.\nOnce I accepted that I\u2019d never be able to publish everything, most individual ideas seemed to matter a lot less. Now, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I post this draft or that one. What matters is that posts go out every day . Ironically, this turned out to be a better filter for good ideas than hoping the market would decide for me. Whatever I can\u2019t publish for a while, will I come back to it organically? Does it pop into my head again unannounced? If I forgot the idea as soon as I woke up the next morning, it can\u2019t have been that important, can it?\nWill I lose some good, perhaps even some great ideas by not scribbling every stray thought onto a piece of paper? Probably. But I will skip a lot more bad ones I\u2019ll never have to think about again, let alone turn them into paper planes which\u2019ll never take flight.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to let go of the unassessed. Important ideas will come back to you\u2014and the ones you\u2019re truly meant to share won\u2019t leave you alone until destiny is satisfied .<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Passion Seeps Through\n\n### Content: \nWeeb Jail is something else. It\u2019s as if 13-year-old me had moved to Japan and started a Youtube channel. So, whenever the unnamed but self-proclaimed \u201cKing of Weeaboos\u201d returns, I press play. This time it took nine months, but, as usual, WJ did not disappoint .\nUntil today, I had never heard of karuta before. 30 minutes later, I feel the incessant urge to learn and master the game. That\u2019s because, as WJ explains in his mini-documentary about an anime, a competitive card game, and his own experience with both: \u201cPassion is contagious. It doesn\u2019t even matter what you\u2019re passionate about. What matters is that you are . And sometimes, if that passion is great enough, it won\u2019t even matter to you, either. What matters is it\u2019s there.\u201d\nWeeb Jail, for example, was the only one passionate enough about Steins;Gate , one of my all-time favorite anime shows, to make a video analysis for every single episode. That\u2019s how I found him and why I stuck with him. But he\u2019s clearly also passionate about making videos , because whereas he usually sits in his room, this time, he filmed himself, the karuta players at a local club, even a whole music clip for the intro of his video. That, too, is contagious.\nPassion seeps through, and while it\u2019s inspiring when it rubs off enough to cause real change , even just witnessing it makes us feel alive. Get your dose of passion every day.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Engaged\n\n### Content: \nThe word \u201cengaged\u201d means a lot of things. For one, it means \u201cbusy.\u201d \u201cOccupied.\u201d \u201cAlready in use.\u201d By the time you agree to marry someone, that sure will be the case. You\u2019ll already have seen your fair share of love. With each other. With the others . But now, you agree to hold out for someone special, and, in the meantime, no one else shall take that special place.\nTo engage also means to attract. To hire. To enter into combat with an enemy, even. Marriage will also be all of those. Sometimes, you\u2019ll feel attracted to one another. At other times, you\u2019ll be fighting. In any case, you\u2019ve hired each other. \u201cI want you to be my partner for life. No one else can do that job.\u201d It\u2019s a decision that needs settling into, but not one to take lightly.\nThere are, however, more interesting definitions still. Architecturally speaking, an engaged column is one attached to a wall. Ideally, that\u2019s what your partner will be, won\u2019t they? A forever-supporter to have your back so that, even if you crumble, you won\u2019t fall completely.\nIn any well-oiled machine, meanwhile, all parts must be engaged. If the gears don\u2019t interlock, the bearings don\u2019t move, the screws don\u2019t hold, the engine won\u2019t go. The clutch must connect to the driveshaft. If it doesn\u2019t, your horsepower will never make it onto the road. That, too, is engagement. To become two parts of one whole , a team that is better and can, ultimately, only function together.\nIn some ways, etymologically, we\u2019ve come full circle. The original stem of the word \u201cengagement\u201d meant \u201cto pawn,\u201d \u201cto pledge\u201d something or, well, someone\u2014usually oneself. Now, we live in a world where engagement is most commonly associated with large companies trying to hold our attention just long enough until they can sell it to the highest bidder. It\u2019s a different kind of pawning, but pawned we are at the end \u2014and we pay dearly to cover the interest.\nIn that sense, perhaps my favorite interpretation of the word is \u201cinvolved.\u201d To consistently give your partner the gift of your presence is, after all, a much more lasting commitment\u2014and sometimes sacrifice\u2014than however much money one might cough up for a ring. \u201cYes.\u201d That\u2019s the answer we\u2019re all hoping for.  But not just, \u201cYes, I want to do the ceremony, have the party, wear the suit.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cYes, I want to be involved. Supporter or connector, entertainer or sparring partner, I\u2019ll be here every day.\u201d That\u2019s worth a lot more than all the jewelry, process, and outward appearances. In fact, it might be the only thing that lasts\u2014and to me, that\u2019s what it means to be engaged.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: The Kind of Letter You Want To Receive\n\n### Content: \n\u201cMaybe we are both idiots?\u201d The words were staring back at me from a postcard. The paper was printed in Italy, but it was written on in German\u2014by a guy in Poland, naturally. My friend Robert\u2014aka Multithink \u2014truly lives up to his online alias.\nRobert has sent postcards in Italian , German, English , Russian, Vietnamese, Czech, Persian , Japanese, Turkish, and Arabic. I told him what a brilliant idea and tradition that was, and, well, two weeks later, I check my mailbox, and\u2026\nSome of Robert\u2019s postcards go to friends. Others to strangers halfway around the world. And whether it\u2019s thinking through his words in another language or merely great effort on his part, he always manages to share a deeply personal message with the recipient.\nIn my case, Robert decided to discuss ideas . \u201cDo you sometimes ask yourself where good ideas come from? Maybe, they appear from the void. Or you can only think of them in the shower, as the internet would have you believe. I believe good ideas are born when we come together.\u201d\nThis is, of course, how Robert\u2019s postcard habit was born, too. He wanted to connect with an online friend. His mom, rather, for she sent him good thoughts in a tough time. But she only spoke Italian. So Robert studied, scribbled, and hoped for the best \u2014and his friend\u2019s mom kept his letter for many years.\nBut it takes more than two people coming together for a good idea to blossom, Robert believes. \u201cIf we want crazy good ideas, we need at least one crazy person. Hence the million-dollar question: Who is the crazy one? You or me? Maybe we are both idiots?\u201d\nMost of my letters these days come from entities demanding money. Those usually don\u2019t make me laugh out loud. Robert\u2019s postcard, however, very much did. That ironic, innocent question, echoing into eternity\u2014or perhaps it was simply the genius of his initiative.\nWrite more letters. Think multi. If you\u2019re feeling a little crazy, maybe you\u2019ll even try writing to someone in their own language\u2014but most of all, write the kind of letter you, too, would actually want to receive.<|end_of_text|>"}

That\u2019s a great question,\u201d I said. \u201cBrilliant!\u201d\nIt makes sense to write a to-do list in the morning, of course. To ask, \u201cWhat needs doing today? \u201d But with it, for most of us, comes the assumption that, naturally, we\u2019ll then work on those items to the exclusion of all else\u2014yet when do we ever? From fun but non-urgent tasks to the completely irrelevant, a million distractions regularly usurp the more important outcomes in our plans. What if we started paying attention to those instead of pretending we can magically keep them at bay by ignoring them?\n\u201cLet me not spend a whole hour watching movie trailers on Youtube again today.\u201d \u201cFinishing my drawing will have to wait until tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI know the boss asked me for it, but it didn\u2019t seem like the competitor analysis was urgent.

Try this question. See where it leads.

{"text":"### Title: The Perfect, Imperfect Filter\n\n### Content: \nIn the two and a half hours we hung out, Michael and I talked about everything under the sun: work, blockchain, productivity, parenting, self-care, writing, creativity, and on and on. One particularly noteworthy topic? Note-taking.\nMichael uses Obsidian , an advanced way to organize and link your thoughts. When he asked how I organize my ideas, I admitted my system was quite rudimentary. Apple Notes for administrative stuff and a basic structure, Evernote to save everything without immediate use, and then, well, a lot of writing drafts filled with notes. I did, however, explain my reason for never bothering to formalize my notes more: I believe the brain is the perfect filter.\nWhen I write an already-long story, I don\u2019t want to comb through every idea I\u2019ve ever had to pick a few relevant examples to include. I\u2019d rather just use what my brain comes up with in that moment. Sure, there\u2019ll always be some recency bias, but often, when you think about a movie you watched last week, you\u2019ll remember a similar one you watched many years ago. Your brain is already full of links. Why not trust them? It is very much imperfect, but this imperfection gives your creations a unique twist. An imprint only you could have made , thanks to whatever your mind delivered in that moment\u2014and that\u2019s beautiful.\nCase in point: On the way home from my conversation with Michael, my brain was buzzing with inspiration. Had I taken notes during our conversation, I probably could have drafted a dozen blog posts on the spot. But I didn\u2019t. I let everything simmer in my head, then picked one question from Michael that stood out to me. That became the next day\u2019s post \u2014and that, in turn, led me to this one. No elaborate system needed.\nNo matter what you do, your net will never be wide enough to catch all idea butterflies . Not all the great and extra shiny ones. Not all the normal ones. And not even all the small swarmers which you could release quickly and go watch them be on their way.\nDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s life. Catch what you can, and enjoy the rest as it flies by. You\u2019ve already got the perfect, imperfect filter\u2014all you have to do is trust it.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: If You Want To Break Something, Use a Hammer\n\n### Content: \nThe Green Hornet is a superhero who\u2019s been reinterpreted many times since his invention in 1936. Similar to Batman, he\u2019s a wealthy publisher who fights crime as a masked vigilante at night. In a 1966 TV show edition , his sidekick and loyal driver, Kato, received a significant upgraded to his previously only alluded to martial arts skills. Why? Bruce Lee played the part.\nDespite the show\u2019s brief, one-season run, many a young fan adored Kato\u2019s cool moves in bringing down the bad guys. Plus, for once, it wasn\u2019t just the main character dealing all the damage. With Lee\u2019s height of only 1.72 m, in this case, it was literally \u201cthe little guy\u201d providing inspiration to people all around the country.\nOne such inspired young girl, named Vicki, summoned her courage to send Bruce a fan letter. She asked him whether he used karate in the show and how she could best break a brick with her hand. In Letters of the Dragon , we can read Bruce\u2019s response.\nAlways a teacher, Bruce first ensured his fan had all the facts: \u201cDear Vicki, the art I use on TV is not karate. It is the ancestor of karate and is known as gung fu, which is of Chinese origin (so is karate).\u201d And then, instead of giving her action-hero platitudes, Bruce decided to continue to teach. In fact, the little piece of wisdom he shared next was sage advice I hope Vicki ended up remembering for the rest of her life: \u201cBreaking boards and bricks are mere stunts and are not recommendable for anyone, especially a girl like you. Techniques are the main goal you should work at. If you want to break something, use a hammer.\u201d\nWatch a good kung fu movie. Most of the time, the master does nothing . They only fight when they have to. Similarly, Jet Li has never been in a real fight \u2014and Bruce Lee did not smash bricks in his spare time.\nIf you want strength, accept . If you want inspiration, dive into a good story. Use that strength and inspiration to bring about real change. After all, more things in life need mending than tearing apart. But if you ever do want to break something, well, then just use a hammer\u2014because even superheroes need efficiency.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Working Titles\n\n### Content: \nEvery time I see the words on the big screen again, I marvel at the brilliance behind the name: \u201ca Working Title production.\u201d Working Title is one of Britain\u2019s most successful movie studios ever, the company behind films like Love Actually , Darkest Hour , and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , among many others. Making their own name one that would forever remain in progress didn\u2019t just make for great marketing . It\u2019s also a good reminder there\u2019s always work left to be done .\nWhen I write, 99% of the time, I also do so under a working title. It helps in several ways. For one, there are now some words where there used to be none, making starting the actual draft a little less intimidating. For another, it\u2019s a working title\u2014if push came to shove, as a title , it would work . So if nothing else, I\u2019ve already got a name under which I can ship the piece if need be. That\u2019s reassuring. At the same time, it\u2019s a working title\u2014a title very much still in the works . I can change it any time . That, too, is reassuring\u2014and thus the writer climbs the confidence ladder , one small step after the other.\nThere\u2019ll always be exceptions, but however soon you can, give your work a title. It takes the pressure off in multiple ways and provides a target to aim at to boot. Who knows? Ship enough working titles, and maybe sometime, we\u2019ll remember you as the Working Title of your field: always tinkering on another potential hit, yet never quite done after shipping the last one.<|end_of_text|>"}

I had a lucid moment and pointed out: \u201cYour product has 1.8 million users. The community team consists of three people. If they give a talk to 1,000 people, and they all end up using it\u2014which would be a tremendous result\u2014you wouldn\u2019t even see a blip in the metrics.\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a good point!\u201d I don\u2019t know if \u201c grow the users \u201d is part of that team\u2019s mandate. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the only one. But in any case, that team must keep asking: \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\nI was out sick for a week, and when I came back, my team had started on a project I was supposed to lead. That\u2019s totally fine, of course, but as a result, the target tone of the project shifted several times in two days. Do we want a technical primer? An extended marketing video? An educational mini-course? The first thing I had to do when I got back was ask: \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d If multiple people are involved, working out the answer can take days\u2014which makes it all the more important. There\u2019s little worse than sprinting through a process no one feels they approved in hindsight.\nThe best questions are often the ones we daren\u2019t ask because we think there must be an obvious answer we\u2019re missing. Usually, we\u2019re not, and other people have the same query on their mind. Even so, it is better to risk looking like a fool today than to guarantee we\u2019ll look like one tomorrow.

I was nervous about a variety of projects going past their deadlines given some reshuffling in our planning at work and me being out sick for a week.\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized the projects veering off course was due to external factors. A request from a senior leader here, a life event there. Plus, given my junior rank in the firm, the best I could likely do was to form alternative solutions, present them, and let my boss decide. That\u2019s exactly what I ended up doing, and, as usual, it all turned out fine.\nWhen a ship gets hit by a cannonball from the enemy\u2019s fleet, it is not the oarsmen\u2019s job to bring the vessel back on track. Only the captain has enough visibility to call the next maneuver.\nHierarchy aside, however, I think the truth of the matter is this: You\u2019re never paid enough to worry. What\u2019s a CEO\u2019s salary compared to the company\u2019s market capitalization? 0.01%? Ultimately, even the person who all fingers point to in the end is but a small fish in a vast ocean.\nAt the end of the day, none of us are paid to sit there in anxiety. We are paid to show up, do our best, solve problems, and try again tomorrow.

Powerful magic that\u2019s bound to corrupt him, strength to withstand even strong enemies\u2019 attacks, and unreliable but enlightening visions of the future\u2014such are the burdens of the chosen one.\nAs Rand and his fellowship are guided to an unknown location by one of the many Aiel clans, he overhears the name of their destination: Rhuidean. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re taking us!\u201d Rand says, pointing at Rhuarc, the clan\u2019s chief. \u201cI know there\u2019s a trial for me there!\u201d\nRhuarc only sighs and shakes his head. \u201cYou know too much\u2014and too little,\u201d he tells Rand. It\u2019s true. Thanks to his visions, Rand knows more about what\u2019s coming than he should, and it puts him in danger. But he also knows less than he would need to know in order for his information about the future to be actually useful\u2014and that, too, puts him in danger.\nOur thirst for knowledge is everlasting. Often, however, the little extra we fight so hard for does us more harm than good. Most of the time, it\u2019s enough to trust that, right now, we have everything we need . Face trials as you meet them, and reap the rewards as they fall. What you know is just enough, and the chosen one always makes it through the day.<|end_of_text|>"}
{"text":"### Title: Using Your Judgment\n\n### Content: \nIn early 1965, Bruce Lee\u2019s father died. He was summoned to Hong Kong to attend the funeral and deal with the estate.\nThe young Lee family didn\u2019t have much money at the time. Bruce was 24 years old. He and his wife Linda had only married the previous August, and their son Brandon was merely a few weeks old. They hadn\u2019t even gone on a honeymoon yet, nor had they been able to afford \u201cproper\u201d wedding rings.\nIn Hong Kong, however, many goods were cheaper than in the United States. Perhaps for this reason, perhaps to distract himself or, as we all sometimes do, to spite his challenging finances, Bruce spent a good deal of his month-long trip shopping for gifts for his wife and family.\nHe scouted for a diamond ring for Linda. He worked on getting her a wig made of real human hair, a hot item in fashion at the time. Lee even thought of his mother-in-law. However, since long-distance phone calls were expensive, Lee\u2019s communication with his family happened mostly via letters, and that made aligning everyone\u2019s requests with the right appointment at the right vendor a challenge.\nBut, as ever, Lee was not discouraged. In one letter, he told Linda: \u201cI have a purse for your mother and if financial situation allows I might be able to pick up more stuffs for her. I\u2019ll try but you know the U.S. Customs, not to mention money problems. I\u2019ll use my judgment.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll use my judgment.\u201d When\u2019s the last time you heard that phrase? Have you ever? And, more importantly, did you trust whoever said it to do so? Here\u2019s a man writing to his family thousands of miles away, saying, \u201cI know money is tight right now, but I still want to treat you and make the most of this opportunity for it. So don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t go crazy. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d Of course, back in the day, Linda had little choice but to trust her husband\u2014yet I\u2019d like to think she would have done so regardless.\n\u201cI\u2019ll use my judgment.\u201d The phrase reminded me how little trust we often extend to one another these days\u2014and how little confidence we usually have in our own ability to make sound decisions. But even 60 years after Bruce\u2019s trip, there\u2019s still plenty of need for both in the world.\nYesterday, I watched Pat Flynn complete a Pok\u00e9mon card collecting challenge. His goal was to obtain a full set of over 250 cards in a single day during a convention. As always, Pat traded and received help from many people along the way. At one point , he gave a 10-year-old kid $400\u2014a literal Mount Dollar-est for a child of his age\u2014to go and restock his trade binder so he could make more deals. \u201cI trust you!\u201d he told the young boy. What a vote of confidence! Only a short while later, the kid returns with a big stack of great cards, which Pat can immediately swap with some other folks for more of the Pok\u00e9mon he needs to complete his challenge.\nIn many ways, our access to infinite, real-time information has made us hypersensitive . We tend towards distrust, worry, and micromanagement. But just because we can see everything, everywhere, all at once, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all relevant to us . In fact, a man without a smartphone who doesn\u2019t do long-distance phone calls and mostly writes letters to communicate can, even today, go through life without major complications . And if that\u2019s not inspiration enough, empowering our kids to become emotionally self-sufficient adults should definitely do the trick.\nMoney, fame, cool hobbies and good deals, even life itself\u2014it all comes and goes. Use your judgment, and you\u2019ll be fine. I have complete faith in you.<|end_of_text|>"}
